WRASSE - SIXLINE	Pseudocheilinus hexataenia
Short Description.
<p>
This awesome little fish is a great addition to any reef tank. The Six Line wrasse will weave in and out of cracks and crevices all day long while picking at algae and flashing you the dazzling colours it has as markings..
</p>

Full Description
<p>
Six Line Wrasse have a blue body with a purple tinge and (wait for it...) 6 lines running horizontally along it. The colours of the lines vary in between shades of yellow and orange. To top off this amazing set of coloration the tail is vibrant green with a tinge of yellow. Now that's what I call a cool fish!
</p><p>
The adult males of this species are generally larger than the females and their colouring will become more vibrant when they are ready to mate.
</p>
<p>
This fish originally comes from the Indo-West and Central Pacific region including the Red Sea all the way to New South Wales and the Great Barrier Reef. They can be found living in protective coral down to 20 metres deep.
</p>
<p>
Six Line Wrasse have never been successfully bred in captivity but are found plentiful in their wild, natural habitat.
</p>
<p>
The blue outlined black spot that you will notice towards the rear of this wrasse is actually a false eye which confuses predators and allows the Six Line Wrasse a little time if need to escape.

<p>
The minimum tank size required for this fish is 120 litres.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
These are quite peaceful fish when housed without other Six Line Wrasse but smaller and shyer species of fish should still be avoided as they will get picked on. Slow moving feeders will also probably be starved when kept with a Six Line Wrasse.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Large Angels, boxfish, damsels and even fancy damsels make good tank buddies with the Six Line Wrasse. They have been known to get along well with tangs also.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Dwarf angels, frogfish, blennies are clownfish  can also be housed with these fish however caution must be taken. You must also watch for signs of aggression with species such as goatfish, gobies, dragonettes and parrotfish. Groupers, triggerfish and snappers may also cause aggressive behaviour so the wrasse should be added to the tank last. It is sometimes possible to house with other types of wrasse as long as they don't look too similar.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Peaceful slow moving fish such as seahorses and pipefish should be avoided as they will be starved to death. Crustaceans and other invertebrates will be most likely eaten so don't put those guys in either. Six Line Wrasse should not be housed with others of the same species and sharks are also a big no-no unless you want this awesome little fella to become dinner.

<h3> Feeding Your Six Line Wrasse </h3>
<p>
This species are carnivorous and as such should be fed a wide variety of protein rich foods, flakes and formulas. They will need to be fed at least twice a day if not more due to their high activity. Six Line Wrasse love picking at live rock and have also be known to clean parasites of other larger fish.
