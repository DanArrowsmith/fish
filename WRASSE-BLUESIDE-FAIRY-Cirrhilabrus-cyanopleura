Short Description.
<p>
These small but incredibly active fish will spend most of their time cruising round the tank looking for food. Along with the bright colours and generally passive nature they are surely a great addition to any tank.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
These fish have a round blue and olive green coloured head with darker purple scales towards the back of the body combined with a lighter belly and red tail fin. The females of the species are browner, smaller and show pale spots along the body. The coloration and patterning of the males can vary depending from where exactly they have come from.
</p><p>Blueside fairy wrasse are found from depths of 2-30 metres in rock and coral reefs all around the Indo East-West Pacific region from the Andaman Sea to the Great Barrier Reef.
</p><p>
The species of wrasse is extremely challenging to breed in captivity. In the wild eggs are scattered and allowed to drift in the water column until settling back onto the reef in a different area.
</p><p>
It's extremely fun to watch these littles guys pop up and down in the aquarium due to their ability to scull their fins, but be careful, they are accomplished jumpers and can easily be lost over the side in an uncovered tank.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Blueside Fairy Wrasse </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for the blue side fairy wrasse is 210 litres.
These fish need plenty of swimming room as they are extremely active but make sure you include plenty of places to shelter so that they can acclimatise. They have been sometimes know to enjoy living in the tentacles of stony coral.
</p><p>As mentioned before it is a must that these fish are housed in a covered tank because of their active lifestyle they can easily swim themselves out and over the top of an aquarium.
<p/><p>Make sure to have a moderately deep sand bed which the fish will use to bury themselves in to sleep at night.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The blueside fairy wrasse are usually peaceful with most of their tank buddies however take should be taken with other similar and same species of wrasse. It's a great idea to pair one male with several females to stop their striking colour patterns from fading and becoming dull. As these are shy and docile fish avoid keeping them with larger more aggressive ones.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Damsels, tangs and angelfish make good tank buddies with the Blueside Fairy Wrasse. They have been known to get along well with boxfish also. Females of the same species are the preferred choice.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Blennies, clownfish, dwarf angels and frogfish can also be housed with these fish however caution must be taken. You must also watch for signs of aggression with species such as dragonettes, parrotfish, goatfish and gobies. Groupers, triggerfish and snappers may also show aggressive behaviour so keep an eye out. It is sometimes possible to house with other types of wrasse as long as they don't look too similar.

</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Although blueside fairy wrasse are generally quite docile fish they could leave slower moving fish such as seahorses and pipefish without food. This species should not be housed with other males of the same species and sharks will most certainly eat them.

<h3> Feeding Your Blueside Fairy Wrasse</h3>
<p>
These fish are carnivorous and will thrive on a diet of frozen and flake foods but make sure it's varied and of high quality if you want your fish looking its best. Meaty foods such as mysis and brine shrimp will be great. Feed them small amounts, several times a day.
