</p>

Full Description
<p>
The Indian Sailfin Tang is truly an eye catching species of fish. The body, which ranges in various shades of grey, has several vertical yellow stripes with intricate patterns, even along the face. Its blue tail is speckled with white spots as well as yellow freckles on its face. This fish can almost double in size by raising and lowering its substantial fins.
</p><p>
This particular species of tang is originally found in the West Indian Ocean and the Red Sea from India and Java through to the Cocos-Keeling Islands. They hang around at depths of between 2-30 metres in pair or small groups close to the rocks.
</p><p>
Indian Sailfish Tangs have not yet been successfuly bred in captivity. This could be due to the fact that there are no differences noted with males and females.
</p><p>
These are quick and agile fish and you'll see them spend most of their time in open areas.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Indian Sailfish Tang</h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 290 litres. This is a large fish and therefore needs plenty of swimming space.
They will need lots of coral and/or rock to use as hiding places and for sleeping during the night. Keep these well secured as the tang's quick movements may easily topple them. Sailfish Tangs love to graze on algae so anything you can do to facilitate this will make them much happier.
<p>This species will appreciate good water movement so much sure to provide at least one area in the tank where moderate current is available for them.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Indian Sailfish Tangs are an extremely mild-mannered species of fish and will get along with almost anything you put them with. However it won't do well with other surgeonfish unless in an extremely large aquarium.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
This species are amazing tank mates with pretty much any other species such as angels, anglers and blennies. They will also get along really well with clownfish, damsels, eels and goatfish. Gobies, groupers, hogfish, parrotfish and puffers will make wonderful tank buddies too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Caution should be used when combining with batfish, butterflies and cardinals as they may get territorial. They should also be watched when paired with some species of rays, triggerfish and squirrelfish. They may be kept with other different species of tangs but it's best to add all of the species together to avoid territory disputes.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Docile, peaceful fish such as seahorses and pipefish should be avoided altogether as they will be too scared of the tang's boisterous nature to come out and eat. The Indian Sailfin Tang won't last very long with a shark in the tank either.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Indian Sailfish Tang </h3>
<p>
These fish are primarily herbivores and as such they like to graze often on marine algae so provide them with plenty of live rock. They will also eat flake foods and frozen/live food if need, just make sure that it's vitamin enriched to help provide for their nutritional needs. Try feeding them about 3 times a day in smaller amounts. Dried seaweed can also be attached to rocks which will contribute to a healthy immune system.
