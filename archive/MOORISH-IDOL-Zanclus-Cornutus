MOORISH IDOL - Zanclus Cornutus

Full Description
<p>
With their distinctive black, yellow and white colours this fish is easily recognisable from everybody's favourite Disney fish film 'Finding Nemo'. They have a distinctive orange band around their pointed snouts which they use to stick into crevices to find food.
</p><p>
Moorish Idols are thought to be originally from the Moors of Africa from which it got its name. They have been seen since all over the Indian and Pacific Oceans. From the southern Red Sea through to the Persian Gulf, this species has even been spotted in Peru. In the wild you'll see them around a variety of habitats including brackish harbours and reefs and have been spotted at depths up to an amazing 182 metres.
</p><p>
This species of fish is extremely delicate to maintain in captivity, let alone breed. Breeding has also been unsuccessful but in nature they are frequently found schooling and it is extremely difficult to determine the difference between sexes.
</p><p>
At night the Moorish Idol will actually darken its colouring in order to blend in more easily and avoid being marked as prey by nocturnal predators.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Moorish Idol </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this fish is 380 litres.
These fish are amazing swimmers and will be seen darting around at lightening speed from time to time hence the need for the largest tank available. Excellent water quality is a must along with areas of high water movement which will help oxygenate and give this species the best chance of success. Aquarium stability is of the utmost importance when keeping this species and those with established tanks and as close to natural sea water parameters as possible will have the most chance of accommodating the Moorish Idol.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Moorish Idols can hold their own against most fish and such tank mates should be chosen wisely to eliminate as much stress as possible.

<p>
Peaceful cave dwellers such as the dotty-back might make a good choice here. Meat eating grazers such as wrasses are presumed to have a higher chance of of incorporating well with the Moorish Idol as well. A small school of multiples of this species can be kept insuring that the tank size is increased appropriately.

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Fin nippers such as damsels may find the Moorish Idol's long banner fin especially tempting so take caution if attempting to house together. Other more dominant fish such as triggers may constantly fight with the Moorish Idol due to its inability to back down from a fight. Territorial fish such as clownfish may be endlessly at odds with it due to its blatant disregard for the clownfish's perceived territory while grazing. If any fish presents even a slight threat it should be removed from the tank immediately.

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
The Moorish Idol is enough of a challenge to keep on its own without adding large predators such as sharks and groupers to the mix. Avoid housing with anything which may see the Moorish idol as prey at all costs.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Moorish Idol </h3>
<p>
This species of fish is omnivorous and as such experiment with a variety of live marine foods. In the wild they feed on sponges and algae so having plenty of live rock will help. Many common frozen angelfish foods contain sponge which would be ideal. Fresh sponge from the ocean may work but be careful that it is properly sourced. You can also try other plant based foods such a nori seaweed.
