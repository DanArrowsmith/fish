Short Description.
<p>
The Antennata Lionfish is a very impressive addition to an aquarium. This fierce looking species is a master predator with long beautiful fins with venomous spines which are used to distract and kill their prey. While hunting they will spread out their fins to disguise the movement of getting closer.

Full Description
<p>
This species of lion fish has a white head and a big mouth with antennae on top of each of their eyes. With a bright red body and darker red vertical stripes combined with long, thin, white fins make this fish a sight to behold. These huge fins will be spread out to the side while hunting and then closed around their prey to prevent escape.
</p>
<p>
The Antennata Lionfish can be found all over the Indo-Pacific region from East Africa all the way through to Australia. They like hiding out in reef crevices during the day and are seen at depths of up to 50 metres.
</p>
They have been known to breed in captivity however it is extremely difficult to raise the offspring.
</p>
<p>
Extra care must be taken with these species of fish due to the venomous nature of the spines. Lion fish spines have even been known to penetrate rubber gloves so be aware of where it is at all times when your hand is in the tank to avoid getting stung.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Antennata Lion Fish</h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species of fish is 210 litres. The tank should be equipped with some sort of cave or crevice to give it a place to hang out. Lighting is irrelevant as these fish like to hide during the day however care should be taken not to point the water pump close to the fish's hiding area. Type of substrate also doesn't matter to this species.
</p>
<p>
If keeping more than one species of lion fish in the same tank then an extra 100 litres of water per lion fish should be added to allow adequate room and avoid territorial fighting.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Lion fish will literally consume anything that can fit inside their mouths so only keep with fish that are larger than itself. Also be aware that these fish need quite a lot of space and an overcrowded tank could result in other fish getting spiked with venom by accident.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Big groupers, snappers, angelfish and even puffers would make excellent tank mates as long as the remain bigger in size than your lion fish. They also won't bother live coral and starfish, cucumbers and hermit crabs. Other species of lion fish can also be kept if tank size guidelines are strictly followed. 
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Success can sometimes be had with sharks and rays of an appropriate size. Invertebrates and crustaceans should be added will caution as depending on size and species may be preyed upon.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Smaller fish species such as sea horses and damsels should be avoided due to the high probability of being eaten. Frog fish have also been known to eat lion fish which are the same size or smaller. Other Antennata lion fish should not be kept together as 2 males will fight and it is impossible to distinguish between sexes.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Antennata Lion Fish </h3>
<p>
These fish have a strictly carnivorous diet that favours shrimp and crab meat however they will eat fish if hungry enough. Avoid freeze dried foods and freshwater fish as their stomachs are quite delicate at times. Feed them medium sized pieces of raw marine crab/shrimp meat around 3 times a week. Be careful with portion sizes as they have been know to choke on pieces that are too big for them.
