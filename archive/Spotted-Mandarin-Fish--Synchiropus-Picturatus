Spotted Mandarin Fish - Synchiropus Picturatus

Short Description.
<p>
What can we say about this fish apart from "Wow!"? The spotted mandarin is one of the most distinctively patterned fish in any aquarium. With its unique striped face mask you'll think you're looking at swimming works of art.

Full Description
<p>
The colouration on these fish is simply outstanding. They have mint green bodies with black splotches ringed in vibrant turquoise and neon orange. Their faces are striped with orange and turquoise resembling ancient war paint. 
</p><p>
The males of this psychedelic fish species can be differentiated from the females due to their longer dorsal spine. 
</p><p>
These fish are found all over the Indo-West Pacific region from the Philippines and Indonesia down to north-western Australia. They're seen along sandy bottoms of shallow reefs and shelter, hidden away, underneath living coral.
</p><p>
These fish when kept as a mating pair are extremely likely to breed in captivity and have been known to spawn 50 or more eggs at a time.
</p><p>
Spotted Mandarins are an extremely resistant species of fish and can often be found sleeping together next to each other on the same rock night after night.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Spotted Mandarin </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for these fish is 120 litres. They are a slow moving species that will generally spend most of their time at the bottom part of the tank looking for food. Slow moving water is preferred and you should do your best to recreate their natural environment of sheltered reef bottoms as much as possible. This means adding sufficient bottom substrate so the spotted mandarin may 'walk' along looking for food and bury itself if it feels stressed. Be sure to provide plenty of corals and rocks on top to give areas for the fish to seek shelter and rest.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Spotted Mandarins are usually peaceful towards all other species of fish but may fight occasionally with other males of the same species. Selected tank buddies should be of a similar size to avoid them over competing for food. Peaceful feeders that consume a different food source would be ideal.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
This species is ideally paired as a male-female combination however it does extremely well with seahorses, pipefish, damsels and clownfish. Small angels, batfish, blennies and boxfish would also make ideal companions. Other species of fish which it will get along well with are cardinals, gobies and tangs.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Caution should be taken when keeping with goatfish, hogfish and other dragonets due to the possibility of them going hungry. Larger angels, grunts, file fish and puffers may also sometimes cause a problem. Keep an eye out on rays, wrasse and squirrelfish too as complications can sometimes arise.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Bigger more boisterous fish such as triggerfish and snappers should be avoided at all costs. Sharks, eels, lion fish, frogfish and other predators will see the spotted mandarin as prey and won't last long.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Spotted Mandarin </h3>
<p>
These fish are carnivorous in the wild and survive on a variety of smaller creatures they come into contact with such as worms, fish eggs and of course copepods. Having a large amount of live rock in your tank will mean the spotted mandarin can survive solely on the copepods that it produces. However if you find that you tank is on the smaller size and the copepod stocks are being depleted entirely it is possible to wean the mandarin from live brine shrimp onto frozen shrimp. Thaw the frozen food first and introduce it slowly into their diet increasing the amount once your fish gets a taste for it.
