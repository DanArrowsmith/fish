//Short Description

<p>
Cleaner wrasse are non-aggressive, pretty little fish. These small guys will help out bigger fish by removing parasites and dead tissue from their body, fins and mouth by hanging around “cleaning stations” that the “host” fish come and visit.

//Profile

<p>
The Cleaner Wrasse ( Labroides dimidiatus ) is a small elongated fish with a pointed snout. Colours include black, blue, silver and white. It has protruding tweezer-like teeth which come in useful for removing parasites and other particles from bigger fish. Cleaner wrasse have been known to remove gills and live tissue by accident so keep an eye on them.
</p>

<p>
They are found in coral reefs and lagoons in the Indo-Pacific region and can grow to a maximum size of 5 1/2 inches (14cm). 
</p>

<p>
Cleaner Wrasses' main natural carnivorous diet consists of ectoparasites and dead tissue from the fish that visit the wrasse’s cleaning station.

<h3>Feeding Your Cleaner Wrasse</h3>
<p>
Give them a diet of small quantities of fresh meaty foods such as brine shrimp. Once your wrasse has adjusted to the aquarium try it with a little seaweed sheet or high quality marine flakes. The most nutritious food will be found by having plenty of tank mates that the wrasse can clean properly. Feeding is the hardest part of keeping these types of fish.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Cleaner Wrasse</h3>
<p>
The minimum size of your tank should be at least 50 gallons (190 litres).
Water conditions 22.2-25.5° C (72-78° F), dKH 8-12, pH 8.1-8.4, sg 1.020-1.025.

<h4>Usually Compatible </h4>

Species such as angelfish, goatfish and bennies are all good choices for a peaceful tank.
