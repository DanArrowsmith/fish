Pomacanthus imperator
Short Description.
<p>
The Emperor Angel Fish has long been sought after for aquarium hobbyists. The colours and patterns change on this fish over the course of their lifetime. Expect your Emperor Angelfish to appear differently as it gets further in adult although still just as stunningly beautiful.
</p>

Full Description
<p>
The juvenile emperor angelfish are black with white and light blue curved stripes along the body honeycombed patterned fins and tails. As they progress into adulthood the tail will start to turn yellow and yellow vertical dashes will start to appear on the body. Full grown emperor angel fish are a sight to behold with yellow and blue horizontal lines along the body and the mouth and dorsal fin becoming trimmed with white.   
</p>
<p>
Emperor Angelfish are found all over the world from East Africa through to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. They have been spotted as far as the Hawaiian Islands, Florida and even Southern Japan.
</p>
<p>
Juvenile fish usually like to hang out on the edge of coral reefs but the adult ones have been known to venture further out into open water.
</p>
<p>
Breeding this type of fish in captivity has not been successful so far.
</p>
<p>
Juveniles have been noted to act as cleaner fish so don't be surprised if you see them nibbling at other larger fish.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Emperor Angel Fish Juvenile </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for the juveniles is 500 litres as they can grow very big into adulthood. If keeping a male-female pair make sure to have at least 800 litres. Make sure to provide plenty of caves and hiding places for them to dart in and out of looking for food. Be aware that these fish may need a larger tank to accommodate them as they progress further into adulthood.
</p><p>
Slight current and regular water changes are advised as this will mimic their natural environment as much as possible.
</p><p>
They are prone to parasites so keep them in a quarantine tank for a couple of weeks first and always add them to your tank last to avoid them establishing territories.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Emperor Angel Fish need to be housed with other large fish. Anything smaller can be a target for the angel fish to bully and act aggressively towards. Also these fish will eat pretty much anything such as soft corals and even smaller fish..
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Suitable tank buddies include smaller angel fish, frogfish, blennies and butterfly fish. They will also get along with clownfish, eels, damsels and groupers. Parrotfish, puffers, wrasses and grunts will be fine as well.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Caution should be taken with batfish, cardinals, boxfish and crustaceans which could be eaten. Along with invertebrates and live coral which will get eaten and nibbled at. Sharks and triggers can be kept in the same tank but must be watched closely for signs of aggression.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Rays should not be kept with this type of angelfish as they have been known to pick at the eyes of slow moving rays. Seahorses are also far too delicate and will probably eaten. Do not house your Emperor Angelfish with other large angelfish as they will become aggressive and fight.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Emperor Angel Fish </h3>
<p>
Give them an omnivorous diet with a wide variety of different types of food. Flake foods and tablets which contain spirulina as well as live foods such as shrimp and other protein sources should be given. We recommend feeding them 2-3 times a day to maintain a higher quality of water. Live rocks should be added to the tank so that they can graze when they feel like it.
