Short Description.
<p>
This amazing specimen of an eel is well suited to aquarium life and perfect for beginner moray owners due to its hardiness and inquisitive lively nature.

Full Description
<p>
The Snowflake Moray Eel can grow up to 36 inches in length and has a dirty white body which is blotched with black vertical bars and yellow polka dots. Its vibrant yellow eyes really make this a stunning species of eel. 
  </p><p>
They are found all over the Indo-Pacific region from Baja California and Mexico all the way over to the East Africa and the Red Sea. It hides and lives solitary among rocks and reef flats of shallow lagoons and seaward reefs. They have been spotted at depths of up to 30 metres deep.
   </p><p>
There are no known differences between the sexes and have not been bred in captivity successfully as of yet. Some think that the Snowflake Moray Eels are hermaphrodites like other eels that come from the same family.
   </p><p>
These creatures have terrible eyesight and will "sniff" the water column to detect food much like snakes do on land. This means that it can be tough for them to differentiate food and your finger so be extra careful as these guys can pack a nasty bite.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Snowflake Moray Eel </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 280 litres and you will need to provide plenty of rock work and overhanging coral to allow the eel to establish hiding places. Everything should be fixed and as stable as possible because the eel will actively try to bury its own pathway and can be quite destructive to your setup. They are heavy eaters so will need an excellent filtration system to keep the water quality high. Moray eels are also accomplished escape artists so make sure to have a tight fitting tank lid because they have been known to fit through the smallest of holes and even remove aquarium lids entirely.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The Snowflake Moray will consume most small fish and crustaceans and as such will need tank buddies that are bigger and more aggressive than it is. More than more adult can be kept in the same tank as long as they are introduced to it at the same time.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
If you can keep a pair or a shoal together then they’d be good tankmates, if they’re peaceful then other peaceful fish that they are compatible with you can list etc.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Again you can look up what fish are going to be usually compatible on the compatibility chart I sent you before.
If its say a wrasse and it’s okay to keep with other wrasses so long as they look different enough or have enough space etc.  Same if you can keep a few together but need to allow a bigger tank or something like that.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Usually this comes down to stuff like who’s likely to eat who, or if they’re a slow moving fish like a Seahorse then you can’t keep them with fish that move quickly and eat the same food as them as they’ll starve etc.  Same with peaceful fish living with aggressive fish that are too scared to come out to eat, they’ll starve too.

<h3> Feeding Your Snowflake Moray Eel </h3>
<p>
This species is carnivorous and in the wild will hunt for small crustaceans such as shrimps, crabs and lobsters. Give them a variety of fresh/frozen shrimps and crabmeat along with thawed squid and fish flesh. Offer them food with tongs but never use your fingers. Be careful not to overfeed them and only offer them what they will consume in a one sitting because they are messy eaters. Live ghost shrimp can be offered when it first arrives in your tank until the eel becomes acclimitised to thawed foods.
