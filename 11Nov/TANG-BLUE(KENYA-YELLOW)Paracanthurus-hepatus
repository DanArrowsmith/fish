Full Description
<p>
Kenya Yellow Blue Tangs could be considered as having an even more spectacular colouration than their Pacific counterparts with a richer deep-blue body colouring and a striking yellow that covers a greater portion of it. This yellow continues all across the belly region which is where this fish gets its name. Be aware that when juveniles won't show all of their yellow markings until they have fully matured. Top all of this with the blue tang's signature black streaking and this makes for one extremely special tang.
  </p><p>
This particular variant of blue tang comes only from the reefs located in the Indian Ocean but are more populated around the country of Kenya which is where is gets the other half of its name.They inhabit fast moving clear water and have been seen at depths down to 40 metres.
   </p><p>
It is suspected that the females are slightly larger than the males however this hasn't been proven. It is notoriously difficult to breed this species in captivity.
   </p><p>
Much like their cousins from the same family the Kenya Yellow Blue Tang has a fin spine which they use to defend themselves. It is venomous so take caution when attempting to handle them.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Kenya Yellow Blue Tang</h3>
<p>
These fish love to swim and as such will need a minimum tank size of 680 litres when fully grown. Make sure to provide plenty of strong water movement in areas as they will thrive in highly oxygenated environments. They will need at least some live rocks for occasional grazing but be sure to arrange them to allow hiding spaces. Don't obstruct swimming areas though and if possible choose a tank will a large bottom surface area rather than a tall one. They will do well in both Fish Only With Live Rock and Reef aquarium setups but remember they will dart around quite a lot so make sure everything is secured properly to avoid clumsy accidents.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
This species is semi-aggressive however will behave peacefully to most other fish that don't belong to the tang/surgeonfish family so keep them singly to avoid heartache.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Tangs will do well with both large and dwarf species of angelfish along with frogfish, blennies and boxfish. Other great options would be clownfish, damsels and eels. Groupers, grunts, filefish and parrotfish will make excellent tank buddies as well.  Snappers, squirrelfish and wrasse should be perfectly fine too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Take caution when combining them with other species of tangs as they probably will become aggressive. When attempting to do this make sure tank size is accounted for and add them all at the same time. Triggerfish, butterflies and batfish can be problematic as well especially if they look similar to the tang. Keep an eye on rays too as tangs have been known to pick at their eyes sometimes.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Slow moving species such a seahorses and pipefish will likely be too scared to come out and eat with the presence of a tang in the tank so avoid those. Sharks will most likely prey upon them too so don't even contemplate housing them with your beautiful new tang.

<h3> Feeding Your Kenya Yellow Blue Tang </h3>
<p>
This species is omnivorous and in the wild will consume a diet mainly based on plankton and small meaty foods. Don't presume it will get rid of all your problem algae in the tank like other tangs, it will mostly only supplement its diet with algae to maintain a healthy immune system. You should offer them chopped raw shrimp, frozen mysis shrimp and a variety of frozen, pellet and flake preparations. If algae isn't present in the tank then dried Nori seaweed can be clipped to a rock or surface around 3 times a week to ensure vitamin intake.
