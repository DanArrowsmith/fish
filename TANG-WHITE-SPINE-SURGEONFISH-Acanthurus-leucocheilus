<h3>Tank Recommendations for White Spine Surgeonfish</h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 950 litres. This is an extremely large species of surgeonfish and requires a LOT of swimming area to keept it happy and reduce aggression.
They will do well in both reef and fish only tanks with well oxygenated water along with plenty of areas with strong current. They will claim a large area of territory which should be provided with plenty of live rock for them to graze.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
White Spine Surgeonfish are a moderately aggressive species of fish and will behave territorial especially if the tank is too small for its size. This feisty specimen won't appreciate any similar looking fish invading its space hence it is best kept with peaceful species of fish which won't go near it.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Clownfish, damsels, eels and goatfish will make suitable tank mates and will get along fine as long as enough space is provided. Hogfish, parrotfish, gobies, groupers and puffers will make great buddies as well provided an even living area for each species is defined.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
The White Spine Surgeonfish with may get territorial with batfish, butterflies and cardinals when kept in smaller aquariums. They should also be watched when paired with some triggerfish and squirrelfish. They may be kept with other different species of tangs but it's best to make sure you only do this in suitable sized large tank. Rays may be housed together with this species but again watch out for displays of aggression. 
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Only one of this species should ever inhabit the same aquarium because as mentioned before they are extremely territorial and will fight constantly until dominance over the other one has been achieved.
As tough as this surgeonfish seems it still won't do well while there are sharks in the tank for obvious reasons. Pipefish and seahorses will be scared and probably die of starvation so those are best avoided as well.

<h3> Feeding Your White Spine Surgeonfish </h3>
<p>
This species of surgeonfish is herbivorous therefore requires a diet rich in a variety of vegetation. White Spine Surgeonfish will eat vegetable flakes if needed, just make sure that it's vitamin enriched to help provide for their nutritional needs. They will graze constantly on micro algae so provide plenty of live rock. Feed them spirulina, broccoli and zucchini 2 to 3 times a day in small amounts. Dried Nori seaweed may also be tied to rocks which will help keep their immune system healthy. A wide varied diet is essential in lowering levels of aggression.
