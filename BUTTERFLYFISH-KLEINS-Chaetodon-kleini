Full Description
<p>
Klein's Butterflyfish is an oval shaped, slender creature with a primarily yellow body and white band running along its centre. Its brilliant white head has a darker blackish blue stripe running vertically through its eye. Its typical snout mouth is also coloured in this darker shade.
</p><p>
These fish are originally from the Indo-Pacific region ranging from East Africa and the Red Sea over to Samoa, Australia and New Caledonia. They have even been spotted around the Galapagos Islands. They are primarily found in coral rich areas and rocky reefs such as lagoons, reef slopes and slides. Usually they hang around in pairs but can sometimes join larger groups of the same or different species of fish at depths of between 4-120 metres.
</p><p>
There is no known differences between male and females and as of yet no one has had any success breeding them in captivity.
</p><p>
Klein's butterflyfish is an extremely durable and hardy species and will adjust well into a variety of tanks.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Klein's Butterflyfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 210 litres if keeping only one however a larger tank should be provided if more are wanted.
They will swim around freely so provide plenty of open space but also some hiding places. Water movement is not a significant factor but they do prefer slower moving. A mix of sand and coral substrate is needed. Be aware that this species of butterflyfish will nip at and eat hard coral species and certain anemones therefore it is not recommended for reef aquariums.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
These are peaceful fish and as such can be kept with most other species even quite aggressive ones. They do well when kept with others of the same species however sometimes two males will occasionally fight so be prepared to separate them if that does happen.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Klein's butterflyfish will do well with both small and large species of angels as well as anglers, batfish and blennies. Boxfish, dragonets, cardinals and clownfish will make great tank buddies too. Other excellent choices include hawkfish, parrotfish, puffers and even lion fish.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
As mentioned before keeping these fish with other butterflyfish is possible but be prepared to separate them if fighting occurs. Caution should also be take when housing with damsels, eels and filefish. Tangs, triggerfish, wrasse and scorpion fish should also be watched in case they become too boisterous. Invertebrates may be added but be aware there may be a chance of being consumed.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Larger predators such as groupers, sharks and snappers will more than likely hunt the butterflyfish so avoid at all costs. Pipefish and seahorses will not co-habitat with butterflyfish easily either. Live coral will almost certainly get picked apart by the Klein's butterflyfish and as such this species is definitely not qualified as reef safe.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Klein's Butterflyfish </h3>
<p>
These fish are omnivores and in the wild will consume a diet containing micro algae and a wide variety of coral. Luckily in the aquarium they will accept a range of foods. Offer them meaty foods such as shrimp as well as dried flakes and frozen preparations of all different types. Sponge based foods will suffice and even dried nori. Offer them different kinds frequently at first until they get acclimatised and then be sure to feed the adults at least two times a day.
