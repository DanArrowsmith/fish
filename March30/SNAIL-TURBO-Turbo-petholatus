SNAIL-TURBO-Turbo-petholatus

Short Description.
<p>
This stunning species of sea snail has been dated back to almost 100 million years ago during the Upper Cretaceous period which makes a great talking point for your home aquarium. These little critters will continually graze on algae growing on the live rock and glass in your tank.

Full Description
<p>
This beautiful creature has a shell that can range from 3 to 10 cm which is a rich brown with dark bands running around it. Scattered with white splotches and other thin stripes.
  </p><p>
These snails are originally found in the Indo-Pacific region ranging from the Red Sea and Madagascar over to Southern Queensland and Western Australia at varying depths. They are seen both alone and in larger grazing groups along the reef bottoms.
   </p><p>
It is extremely difficult to breed these particular species of snail in captivity as opposed to other similar turbo snails which can quickly turn into hundreds. There is no known way to distinguish between males and females. Their genus name comes from the word "turban" which is what their shells seem to resemble.
   </p><p>
They are a great option for beginner saltwater aquarium owners. Turbo snails are more active during the night but can still be seen sometimes venturing out during the day to look for food and graze. Depending on their size it can seem like they can hide in almost any nook or cranny.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Turbo Snails </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for turbo snails is 120 litres per snail. Add another 100 litres per snail as a common mistake is adding too many of them to the same tank thus causing them to starve. Snails require calcium for their shells so make sure your water has sufficient levels. Be sure to provide plenty of live rock for them to roam around on although sometimes you may see them crawling along the inside of the glass. Make sure you have a tight fitting aquarium lid just in case they decide to climb over the top. No special lighting or water movement is required.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Turbo snails are extremely peaceful animals but care must still be taken when choosing what other species to house them with. Take into account any other species of algae grazers such as tangs when picking the amount of snails to keep. They can and will knock over small pieces of coral that aren't tired down.

<p>
Clownfish, cardinals and blennies will get along great with these guys. Other wonderful choices include damsels, dragonets and gobies. Other invertebrates as well as scorpionfish should be perfectly fine as well. Tangs are a good option too. Turbo snails will leave your live corals alone but they may knock them over by accident.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Take caution when combining them with both dwarf and large species of angels. Frogfish, batfish and boxfish should be watched carefully as well. Other species that should be kept together only under close supervision include butterflies, groupers and grunts. Goatfish, hawkfish and rays may prey upon them sometimes also. You may have similar problems when housing with squirrelfish and snappers.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Avoid keeping turbo snails with eels and filefish as they will most likely get eaten. Hogfish, parrotfish and puffers should also be avoided completely too. Other species which you shouldn't consider are triggerfish and wrasse. You should steer clear of all species of sharks as well.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Turbo Snail</h3>
<p>
This species are herbivores and will survive on a diet mostly consisting of naturally occurring algae that grows on live rock and other tank surfaces. If needed you can supplement their diet with dried seaweed however this should only be used if sufficient algae is not present.
