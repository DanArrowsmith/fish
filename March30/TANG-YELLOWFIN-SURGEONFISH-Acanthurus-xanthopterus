Full Description
<p>
This species can vary greatly in colouring. The can sometimes have a wide yellow stripe running down their eye along with blue stripes along the fin. Its body is normally a faint white colour fringed with deep purple.  They have a small spine on either side which they use to defend themselves.
  </p><p>
These fish are found all over the world but seem to be more concentrated in Japan and Northern Australia but have been spotted from the Gulf of California all the way over to East Africa. They have been found at depths down to 100 metres. They sometimes like to school and are capable of surviving various zones including deep water, sandy bottomed lagoons and reef slopes. 
   </p><p>
So far no one has been successful when attempting to breed these fish in captivity, these has however been reports of spawnings in public aquariums. No differences between the sexes have been identified.
   </p><p>
This high energy fish starts off as a small yellow juvenile but will quickly grow up to almost 28 inches with a personality just as big to match.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Yellowfin Surgeonfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size due to their huge size is at least 750 litres which needs to also be 2.5 to 3 metres long to allow it plenty of space to swim around. They will need lots of rocks and/or coral hideaways in which they can wedge themselves into at night for sleeping. Surgeonfish love water movement because they require lots of oxygen so provide at least one area of the tank with strong water movement. Normal lighting conditions will suffice as long as some dimly lit areas are available. They will spend most of their time in the open water areas of the tank but will hide in crevices during the night.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Surgeonfish are semi-aggressive in nature but the yellowfin does seem to get along with most other fish. They can be territorial with other members of the genus especially in they look similar.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
This species will do well with dwarf and large types of angelfish along with anglers blennies and boxfish. Clownfish, crustaceans and damsels would make perfect tank buddies too. Other species which would make excellent choices include eels, filefish and goatfish. Gobies, groupers and hawkfish are other good options as well.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Take caution when keeping these surgeonfish with species such as triggerfish, tangs and rays. Cardinals, butterflies and batfish should also be watched carefully as well.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Even though they are a big species they could still be possible seen as prey by certain species of sharks so please avoid keeping them together. Also due to their big and boisterous nature, smaller more docile species such as pipefish and seahorses could be to frightened to come out of hiding and feed.

<h3> Feeding Your Yellowfin Surgeonfish </h3>
<p>
This species is omnivorous and in the wild will feed upon the detritus hidden in the sand. In captivity however they will will be happy with a variety of foods including flakes, pellets, algae and small crustaceans. They will also love frozen foods such as mysis and brine shrimp as well as marine formulas that contain spirulina. Feed them at least three times a day, but only enough for them to eat in one sitting. Some aquarium owners have had success with boiled vegetables such as broccoli and lettuce.
