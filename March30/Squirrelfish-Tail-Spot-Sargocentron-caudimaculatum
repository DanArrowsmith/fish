Squirrelfish-Tail-Spot-Sargocentron-caudimaculatum

Short Description.
<p>

Full Description
<p>
This reddish coloured fish turns it tail white during daylight hours. It's distinctive big eyes helps it to see and hunt at night. These guys start off small but can quickly grow to full adult size. They have a large non venomous spine which can protract so take care when attempting to handle them.
  </p><p>
Tailspot squirrelfish are originally found in the Indo-West Pacific ocean from East Africa and the Red Sea over to Southern Japan and Australia. They live under ledges in shallow drop-offs and lagoons and can be seen at depths down the 45 metres. They are usually alone or in small groups sheltering during the day and coming out to feed at night.
   </p><p>
Squirrelfish have the unusual ability to create sounds by contracting their swim bladders. These noises can range from quick pops and crackles to a constant low rumbling and are extremely entertaining.
   </p><p>
This species is extremely sensitive to noises and can get agitated by tapping on the glass so be aware especially if children are close to the aquarium.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Tailspot Squirrelfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size is 380 litres and you should be sure to include plenty of hiding places such as caves which are big enough to fit their adult size. As this is a nocturnal species try to avoid having a brightly lit tank. If intense lighting is necessary such as in a reef environment be sure to provide plenty of overhangs and caves as mentioned above but note that this may mean that your fish will be slightly less visible during daylight hours. No special water movement requirements are needed.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
These fish are best maintained in small groups as they are quite a peaceful species. They are however predators and as such care should be taken not to keep smaller sized fish in the same tank as them which could be seen as prey. Ornamental shrimp are one of their favourite things to eat.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Good tank buddies can include large and dwarf angels, frogfish and batfish. Boxfish, clownfish and filefish will make excellent friends as well. Other great options could be goatfish, grunts and hawkfish. Hogfish, parrotfish and puffers will get along great as well. Rays, tangs and other squirrelfish should be perfectly fine too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Take caution if attempting to keep with species such as wrasse, triggerfish and scorpions. Sharks, lionfish and eels should be chosen carefully as well depending on their size. Other species to keep a close eye on would be crustaceans, invertebrates and butterflies. Damsels, gobies and dragonets should be watched carefully too.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Avoid keeping these squirrelfish with other species such as groupers and snappers. Seahorses and pipefish may be too intimidated in the presence of them so avoid those too.

<h3> Feeding Your Tailspot Squirelfish </h3>
<p>
Squirrelfish are carnivores and as such require a meaty diet which can include chopped fish and shrimp flesh, frozen brine and mysis shrimp along with other frozen foods designed for carnivores. Feed them once or twice a day. You may have difficulty getting them to feed at first due to their nocturnal habits, in this case small live foods such as guppies, shrimp and worms should be offered. In time they will adapt to accept frozen foods.
