BUTTERFLYFISH-OCELLATE-Parachaetodon-ocellatus
Short Description.
<p>
The Ocellate Butterflyfish is an attractive species of decorative butterflyfish that is well suited to intermediate aquarium owners. It easily adapts to large community aquariums and is currently the only classified fish in its genus.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
This butterflyfish is white with 5 yellow brown vertical stripes running along its body and owns a false eyespot on the base of its tail. Not often seen in the aquarium trade they will make a stunning addition to big fish only tank environments.
  </p><p>
These fish are originally found all over the Indo-Pacific region ranging from Fiji and Sri Lanka over to the Great Barrier Reef and New South Wales. They inhabit shallow bays and can be found at depths down to 30 metres. They love hanging round on flat bottomed seagrass beds. 
   </p><p>
These fish will form pairs during breeding season but have been seen to school in large numbers as adults around muddy deep areas. No known success has been had when attempting to breed this species in captivity although they have been known to spawn in larger public aquariums.
   </p><p>
Ocellate butterflyfish have a distinctive vertical band running through their eyes which is thought to have developed to confuse predators especially when combined with the false eyespot located on its tail.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Ocellate Butterflyfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size required for this species is 280 litres and will need to contain plenty of wide open swimming space. 
The should ideally be kept in fish only tank environments but can be kept in certain reef aquariums if caution is taken. No specific lighting or water movement is necessary.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The Ocellate butterflyfish are a peaceful species and as such should be kept with other peaceful non-aggressive fish. As mentioned before reef environments should be avoided as they have been known to eat small decorative invertebrates. 
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
This species will do great with both large and dwarf species of angelfish along with frogfish and batfish. Blennies, cardinals and boxfish would make wonderful choices for tank buddies as well. Other great options could include dragonettes, goatfish and gobies. Grunts, lionfish and hawkfish are other excellent tank mates too. Parrotfish and puffers are also a good fit.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Take caution when combining them with wrasse, triggerfish and tangs. Squirrelfish and rays should also have a close eye kept on them if attempting to house them with butterflyfish. Other species to watch out for include eels, fancy damsels and filefish. Small species of crustaceans and invertebrates may be preyed upon. Be careful when keeping them with other species of butterflyfish especially ones that look similar.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Avoid keeping this species with larger predators such as groupers and sharks. Snappers should also be avoided for similar reasons. Smaller more docile species such as pipefish and seahorses may be too shy to come out and eat in the presence of a boisterous swimmer like the Ocellate butterflyfish.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Ocellate Butterflyfish </h3>
<p>
These fish are omnivorous in the wild and should be supplied with a meaty diet supplemented by flake foods containing Spirulina. They are well known for being problematic to begin feeding. Small clams can be added to the tank in half shells to entice feeding as well as pressing soft foods onto dead coral skeleton. Feed them several times daily at first until they are comfortable eating.
