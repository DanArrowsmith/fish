Full Description
<p>
While not the most brightly coloured angelfish they are one of the most delicate looking. Lamarck's Angelfish have a white body with distinctive horizontal black stripes. Females of the species are distinctive due to the uppermost stripe smoothly arching over the wide part of their backs with a matching stripe on the top part of the tail. 
  </p><p>
These fish are originally from the Indo-West Pacific region from the Great Barrier Reef up to Southern Japan. They are found in a range of habitats including reef crests and steep slopes. They reside in depths between 10 and 40 metres alone or in small groups.
   </p><p>
Females also lack a specific blue spot on the pectoral fin which is present on the males. The differing features of the sexes has led them to be described as different species occasionally. Breeding has been successful however only in large enough aquariums. Spawning is not normally observed in smaller scale home aquariums. 
   </p><p>
The Female Lamarck's Angelfish are an easy species to look after. Two females will not act aggressively towards each other however 2 males can be territorial but the weaker male will eventually transform into females.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Female Lemarck's Angelfish</h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size  required for this species is 280 litres for one fish with a size of 350 recommended for multiple fish.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>

</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
These fish will get along great with frogfish, blennies and butterflies. Clownfish, damsels and eels will also make excellent tank buddies. Other species which shouldn't have a problem with are filefish, goatfish and groupers. Grunts, hawkfish and hogfish are other wonderful options too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Batfish, boxfish and cardinals can sometimes be problematic. Other species with need to have a close eye kept on them include dragonettes, crustaceans and gobies. Invertebrates and triggerfish should also be watched carefully. Sharks can sometimes prey upon this species of angelfish so select them appropriately for their size.

<h3> Feeding Your Female Lemarck's Angelfish </h3>
<p>
These fish are zooplanktivores in the wild but in captivity they will thrive on an omnivorous diet. They will do well on typical angelfish protein based foods. Most of their diet should consist of meat based foods such as mysis and brine shrimp as well as chopped fish and shrimp. Feed them small amounts at least twice a day. Higher temperature tanks may need a higher frequency of feedings. Flake and pellet food is also acceptable.
