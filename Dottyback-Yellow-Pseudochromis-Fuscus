</p>

Full Description
<p>
The Yellow Dottyback has a bright sunflower colouration but depending on dietary intake they can vary from canary yellow to a dusky brown/purple. It can grown up to 4 inches long with an equally big ego to match. They will hold their own in the most aggressive of tanks and as such make for very exciting viewing however their assertive nature means they are probably not best suited for peaceful tanks.
</p><p>
The males of the species are a little larger than their female counterparts and also slightly more vibrant in colouring and are easily bred in captivity. The males have been seen to perform a mating dance outside of a cave to attract the attention of a female who will then enter to lay her eggs.
</p><p>
This species of fish are most often found in reef lagoons and slopes, tide pools and pretty much anywhere with coral all around Indonesia but can be found all over the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean.
</p><p>
These fish are an extremely hardy species but as impressive as they may be yellow dottybacks do have a reputation of being exceptional bullies so great for the unexperienced tank owner but definitely not for the faint hearted.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Yellow Dottyback</h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species of fish is 120 litres and will do well in almost any tank setup as long as plenty of live rock caves and crevices are provided.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
As with most dottybacks they are quite territorial around other similar shaped and sized fish but are not easily bullied by larger more aggressive ones. These fish are best suited for a strongest will survive tank rather than one with shy or very small tank mates.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
The yellow dottyback will do well in tank environments typically reserved for boisterous wrasses, pufferfish and trigger fish. Tangs, large damselfish, angels and parrots will also make good tank buddies along with other larger fish that are not easily intimidated.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
This species of fish will behave territorial around other fish of the same species and genus so caution must be taken when housing with other dottybacks. Success has been had given a large enough tank and space for them to call their own.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Shy, timid fish such as seahorses and pipefish should be avoided at all costs due stress caused by the dottyback. Dottybacks have been known to consume small species of shrimp and bristle worm so be prepared to lose these if any exist in your tank.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Yellow Dottyback</h3>
<p>
These fish are carnivorous and will enjoy a wide variety of meaty foods such as brine shrimp and frozen marine preparations. Chopped raw squid and mussels along with clams and marine sponge will ensure a healthy vitamin intake. You can try them with a small amount of plant matter or marine algae to help this along as well. The more varied the diet. the brighter the colouration so it's worthwhile making sure they have all the vitamins needed. Feed them 2-3 times daily with roughly the amount that they can consume in about 8 minutes.
