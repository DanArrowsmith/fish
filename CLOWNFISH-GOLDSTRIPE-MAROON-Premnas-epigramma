Short Description.
<p>
The Goldstripe Maroon Clownfish are very popular marine aquarium fish because they are highly regarded as being easy to keep. Similar but different in coloring to everyone's favorite character from 'Finding Nemo. These fish have been known to be territorial so it's best to keep them as a pair.

Full Description
<p>
The gold stripe maroon clownfish are a deep maroon colour with thick distinctive yellow stripes on them. This particular type of clownfish is actually quite a recent discovery as they appear very similar to the Maroon Clownfish (Premnas biaculeatus). The distinctive gold/yellow bands will develop after being paired up in an established tank. 
</p>
<p>
These exotic fish are found around the island of Sumutra in Indonesia.
</p>
<p>
These fish don't actually need an anemone to survive however if one is provided the clownfish will reside inside it. They are not fussy about which type of anenome to make their home.
</p>
<p>
Goldstripe Maroon clownfish have been known to breed in captivity. It's interesting that when the female dies or is removed from the tank the largest male will transform into a female and the most dominant younger male will develop into the female.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Goldstripe Maroon Clownfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for these fish is 1200 litres.
To make the most out of your clownfish experience a bubble tip anemone should be added, these guys love to hide inside and dart out when required. However they will reside anywhere in the tank.
If paired off for breeding and less aggression a suitable flat surface such as a rock should be added to provide an area to lay eggs.
</p>


<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
They may be aggressive to other clownfish in the tank and will often bully smaller fish. If an anemone is included in the tank they will defend it very aggressively. They are better kept with bolder fish rather than smaller peaceful ones.

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Again you can look up what fish are going to be usually compatible on the compatibility chart I sent you before.
If its say a wrasse and it’s okay to keep with other wrasses so long as they look different enough or have enough space etc.  Same if you can keep a few together but need to allow a bigger tank or something like that.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Usually this comes down to stuff like who’s likely to eat who, or if they’re a slow moving fish like a Seahorse then you can’t keep them with fish that move quickly and eat the same food as them as they’ll starve etc.  Same with peaceful fish living with aggressive fish that are too scared to come out to eat, they’ll starve too.

<h3> Feeding Your Goldstripe Maroon Clownfish </h3>
<p>
These fish are well known to be extremely good eaters. In the wild they feed on zooplankton and algae. In your tank provide them with a good variety of flakes and frozen marine preparations. Keep an eye out to watch them feeding the anemone, it's very cool. Every once in a while try them with live food.
