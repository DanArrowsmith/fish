Male-Zebra-Angelfish-MED-Genicanthus-caudovittatus

Short Description.
<p>
This is one of the rare occasions when a male of the species is generally considered more attractive than the female. This zebra shaded angelfish is only occasionally seen in the aquarium trade and therefore will make a very special addition to your tank.

Full Description
<p>
Male Zebra Angelfish have pale blue bodies with a multitude of thin dark coloured stripes running down its zebra patterned sides. They can grow up to 10 inches and have a distinctive swallow tail similar to other members of this genus.
  </p><p>
They are originally found only in the Western Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. They inhabit steep reef walls at depths between 10 and 70 metres. They are often found in pairs but usually can be spotted in groups of females dominated by one male.
   </p><p>
 All members of this species start their lives as females and the most dominant one will transform sexes if required. They are also classified as a sexually dimorphic species which means the colouring of the sexes differs greatly with the females being a light grey colour and only two dark bands running down their bodies.
   </p><p>
The male zebra angelfish will display courtship rituals to his harem of females by positioning himself by their sides and fluttering until his whole body begins to vibrate.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Male Zebra Angelfish</h3>
<p>
This species is a deep water variety and as such needs moderate lighting with good water movement to mimic their natural environment as closely as possible. They require lots of open swimming space to move around therefore the minimum tank size for these fish is 480 litres. Add some corals and rocks for decorations as well as creating hiding places for them to take shelter in. This angelfish is suitable for both reef and fish only tank environments.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The Zebra Angelfish is a relatively peaceful addition to any tank environment but they will fight if more than one male is present in the aquarium so if keeping multiples of them make sure there is only one male along with several other females as needed. Other species of angelfish can be attempted as long as they aren't too similar coloured.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Clownfish, goatfish and damsels will not cause any problems. Grunts, hogfish and hawkfish would make great choices as tank buddies as well. Other wonderful options could include butterflies, blennies and basslets. Puffers, tangs and parrotfish are excellent considerations too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Both large and dwarf angelfish can sometimes be problematic as well as batfish. Choose groupers and eels carefully depending on their size too. Invertebrates and crustaceans should have an eye kept on them especially if they are of a small variety. This species has be known to pick at the eyes of rays sometimes as well.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Sharks should be avoided due to these angelfish being not quite big enough to be overlooked as food and will most likely get preyed upon. The boisterous nature of the zebra angelfish may cause docile, more shy species such as pipefish and seahorses to become too frightened to venture out and feed.

<h3> Feeding Your Male Zebra Angelfish </h3>
<p>
In the wild this species consumes plenty of open water plankton therefore you should mimic their natural feeding habits as much as possible by offering them several feedings a day. Angelfish preparations will be ideal along with healthy flake foods containing spirulina. Algae can be offered as an occasional change in diet. Be sure to also provide them with wide variety of meaty items such as frozen brine and mysis shrimp.
