Full Description
<p>
Females of this species can grow up to 7 inches in length and have white bodies with black and blue horizontal stripes that morph vertically as they approach the head. The way the tail connects with its body resembles a swallow's tail and allows it to swim around with ease.
  </p><p>
These fish are found all over the Indian and Western Pacific Ocean ranging from the Cocos-Keeling Islands to Indonesia, the Philippines and even Tonga. They inhabit deep reef walls and have been spotted down at depths of 90 metres. 
   </p><p>
No success has been had when attempting to breed this species in captivity. They are known as a sexually dimorphic species which means the males have a distinctively different colouring than the females. Males bodies are grey with horizontal yellow stripes. 
   </p><p>
Take caution when handling these fish as they have spines located in their cheeks just behind the gills which can come out when they are stressed or frightened. They can be quite shy when first entering a new environment but don't worry they will soon become more comfortable and outgoing.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Basslets, blennies and butterflies would make great options as tank buddies. Clownfish, damsels and goatfish are other excellent choices. Other wonderful tank buddies could include grunts, hawkfish and hogfish. Parrotfish, puffers and tangs will not cause any problems either.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Batfish can sometimes be problematic as well as other species of both large and dwarf angelfish. Eels and groupers should be chosen carefully too depending on their size.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Docile shy and slow moving species such as seahorses and pipefish may find this angelfish too boisterous for their liking and be too afraid to come out and feed. Sharks should be avoided also as depending on their size they may see the angelfish as prey.

<h3> Feeding Your Bellus Swallowtail Angelfish</h3>
<p>
Offer them several feedings a day as in the wild they will consume a lot of open water plankton. They are omnivores and as such give them a good variety of both meat and plant foods. Angelfish preparations are perfect along with frozen mysis and brine shrimp. Flake foods containing spirulina will help to keep up a healthy immune system. They will love the occasionally serving of algae as well.
