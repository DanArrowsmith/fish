ANGELFISH-KORAN-ADULT-Pomacanthus-semicirculatus


Short Description.
<p>
The Koran Angelfish is one of the more easier types of angelfish to keep. Adults are extremely smart as well as beautiful and are sure to make a big impression in your home aquarium.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
Adult Koran Angelfish can grow up to 15 inches if given the proper space. They have small yellow mouths and dark yellow bodies which gradually gets darker closer to the tail. The gills and fins are outlined with a neon shade of blue. These fish have a huge amount of character and are very easily tamed.
  </p><p>
This species is originally from all over the Indian and Pacific oceans ranging from Indonesia and Japan over to Queensland, New South Wales and even New Guinea. Adult fish are normally found alone and always around dense coral areas which provide cover for protection. They have been seen at depths down to 30 metres.
   </p><p>
So far there has been no success in breeding this species in captivity however spawning has been observed but the larvae has proven extremely difficult to raise in a captive environment. The males are generally larger and slightly more pale than their female counterparts.
   </p><p>
The Koran Angelfish can live up to 21 years in captivity so rest assured you will be enjoying watching them swim around your tank for a long time to come.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Koran Angelfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 510 litres as they are very active swimmers. They can be a little fussy so only add them to well established tanks that are at least 6 months old. Water quality should be of high importance due to the amount of food waste that they can create. They should be kept in Fish Only environments with plenty rocks for decoration as well as hiding spaces where they can seek shelter. The Koran Angelfish will spend their time in all areas of the tank and much prefer slower moving water. No special lighting requirements are needed.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
This species is a semi-aggressive one but with the correct tank mates can become a valued member of the community. Be sure to add it to the tank last otherwise it will establish territory and defend it ruthlessly when other species are added. They do not get along with other species of angelfish so always keep them singularly unless in a mated male-female pair.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Great options for tank buddies could include butterflies, frogfish and clownfish. Damsels, eels and goatfish would make wonderful choices as well. Other wise choices would be species such as grunts, groupers and hogfish. Parrotfish, puffers and lion fish will also get along fine with them too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Take caution if attempting to house this species of angelfish with invertebrates and live corals as they will pick at most.  Some slower moving species of sharks may also get their eyes nipped at as well. Triggerfish, filefish and cardinals can sometimes be problematic too. You should also keep a close eye on boxfish and batfish.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Rays should be avoided completely as these angelfish will love to have a nibble at the eyes. Docile species such as pipefish and seahorses will more than likely be too frightened to come out and eat. As mentioned before do not attempt to keep them with other large species of angelfish.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Koran Angelfish</h3>
<p>
In the wild this species is omnivorous and will feed on sea sponges and other similar creatures. In the aquarium it is essential that you provide them with a wide varied diet of both meat and vegetables foods. Give them lots of different prepared formulas, frozen and live offerings. Good meaty items to try them with could include mussels, scallops and squid mixed with vegetable matter. Angelfish preparations containing marine sponge will also go down well. Feed them at least 3 times a day as you will be surprised by the amount of food they can consume.
