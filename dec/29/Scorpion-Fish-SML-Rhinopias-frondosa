Scorpion-Fish-SML-Rhinopias-frondosa

Short Description.
<p>
While these amazing predators may not be too lively they are a fascinating attraction for the right home. Scorpionfish will lie in wait on the bottom until prey comes into range before pouncing on its food. 

</p>

Full Description
<p>
This species is a master of camouflage with extended branch like appendages that allow them to hide amongst algae growth and disguise themselves from potential prey. They can grow up to a maximum size of around 9 inches and have a variety of colourings and shadings depending on their environment.
  </p><p>
These fish are originally found all over the Indo-West Pacific region including East Africa, Japan and Mauritius. They hang around in sandy bottoms and muddy environments close to reef areas. Scorpionfish have been spotted at depths between 3 and 90 metres.
   </p><p>
When hungry the scorpionfish can be noticed 'hopping' to get closer to its food as well as swaying back and forth to imitate debris and in turn luring curious prey further within its range.
   </p><p>
Scorpionfish have extremely venomous spines which are used for protection from other predators. Although they are not malicious use a high level of caution when putting a hand in the tank as a sting from one of these spines usually results in a visit to the hospital.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Scorpionfish </h3>
<p>
Although they can grow quite large due to the fact that they hardly move around the minimum tank size for this species is a respectable 230 litres. They are not reef tank suitable and best kept in a fish only environment and even on their own in a smaller nano style tank setup. Minimum water movement is advised as they are fairly inactive and will spend most of their time on the bottom substrate in one place waiting for prey to pass by. Some rock work should be provided to allow it to feel like it can blend into the surroundings.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The Scorpionfish will prey upon anything that moves and is large enough to fit inside its mouth. It should be housed with peaceful tank buddies which will leave it alone and not try to nip at the venomous spines located on its back.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Large species of angels, boxfish and frogfish are perfectly fine tank buddies. You shouldn't have any problems with batfish, eels and hogfish either. Lion fish, parrots and puffers would make other wonderful choices too. Other scorpionfish, snappers and tangs should also not be problematic.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Take care when attempting to keep them with sharks, triggerfish and wrasse. Squirrelfish, grunts and filefish should have a close eye kept on them as well. Other species to watch carefully include goatfish, butterflies and dwarf species of angelfish.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Avoid smaller species such as basslets, blennies and clownfish as they will more than likely get eaten. Dragonets, damsels, seahorses and pipefish shouldn't be considered either for the same reason. Don't attempt to keep them with rays as they could easily come into contact with the scorpionfish spines.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Scorpionfish </h3>
<p>
These fish are carnivores and in the wild will consume a steady diet of that is high in fats and protein. Try to mimic this as much as possible by offering them live food such as small marine fish and crustaceans. They can be weaned onto non-living food by impaling flesh on long sticks and wiggling it in front of them to entice a feeding response. They may be difficult to feed when first getting comfortable in a new environment, in which case live glass shrimp has been shown to be most effective. Small live freshwater fish can be offered as the occasional treat however they do not contain the required fatty acids that these fish need. Their sedentary nature means that they have quite a slow metabolism therefore 3 - 4 feedings a week should be plenty.
