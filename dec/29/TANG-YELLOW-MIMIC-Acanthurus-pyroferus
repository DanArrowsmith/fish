TANG-YELLOW-MIMIC-Acanthurus-pyroferus

Short Description.
<p>
This interesting species of tang is known for taking on the form of nearby fish while it is juvenile to protect itself. They are one of the easier species of tang to care for as they don't get as large as others but still remain just as beautiful.

Full Description
<p>
Mimic tangs have disc shaped bodies and the adults are coloured a dark yellow- brown or purplish colour with orange patches. Some have dark yellow bands running down their bodies and encircling the eye. As juveniles they will mimic the shading of various different types of pygmy angelfish, most likely for protection until their scalpel like spines become mature.
  </p><p>
This species is found all over the Indo-Pacific region from Japan, Indonesia and the Seychelles all the way over to Tuamotu. They are normally found on their own around reef slopes and shallow lagoons that are rich in dense coral and have been spotted down at depths of up to 60 metres.
   </p><p>
No sexual differences have been noted for the Mimic Tang and no success has been had when attempting to breed them in captivity yet. Some spawning has been reported in public aquariums however it has never been possible to raise the young.
   </p><p>
As mentioned before the adults of this species have sharp spines so you should take extra care when handling them in any way.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Mimic Tang </h3>
<p>
Although not a large species of tang they still require lots of wide open swimming space so a minimum tank size of 290 litres is required. Create plenty of nooks and crevices with coral and rock for them to make themselves feel safe in as well as wedging into at night to sleep. Tangs love well oxygenated water so make sure to provide them with at least one area in the tank that has strong water movement. These fish will do well in both a fish-only and reef aquarium environment. They will graze on naturally occurring algae so a good amount of live rock would be a great idea.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
These fish are semi aggressive and can sometimes be territorial especially when housed with other tangs that look too similar. They can hold their own with other larger, more aggressive tank buddies.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Tangs will do well with both large and small species of angelfish. Clownfish, damsels and eels would also be excellent options. Other great choices include goatfish, puffers and parrotfish. Groupers, filefish and snappers will get along just fine with this species of tang as well.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Batfish and butterflies can be problematic sometimes so keep an eye on them. Other species that should only be considered carefully are rays and triggerfish. Other species of tang can sometimes be kept together with caution. Make sure to add them to the tank at the same time and that they aren't too similar looking.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Shy, docile species such as pipefish and seahorses will be too scared by the tang's boisterous nature. Sharks will see the tang as food and more than likely prey upon it so avoid them at all costs.

<h3> Feeding Your Mimic Tang</h3>
<p>
The Mimic Tang is primarily a herbivore and in the wild will spend its time grazing on algae located on rocks and coral bases. In the aquarium you should provide them with a small amount of meaty foods such as brine or mysis shrimp but the majority of their diet will come from vegetables. Frozen preparations containing algae or spirulina would be ideal. Pieces of nori seaweed can be clipped to rocks or tank sides to simulate grazing areas too. Vitamin C supplements have been shown to help prevent a variety of diseases. Frozen broccoli and spinach has been reported as successful by some aquarium owners.
