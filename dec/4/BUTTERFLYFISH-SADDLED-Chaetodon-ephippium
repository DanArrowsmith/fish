BUTTERFLYFISH - SADDLED	Chaetodon ephippium

Short Description.
<p>
This popular species of butterflyfish is highly sought after in the aquarium trade. Not only is it an outstanding fish but it is also one of the easier types of butterflies to keep.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
This fish is greyish yellow in colour with a large black marking on its back. It has a more pronounced snout than other butterflies as well as orange and blue stripes. What is most impressive about this creature is the long banner-like filament tracing from its dorsal fin.
  </p><p>
This species is originally found all over the East Indian and Pacific Oceans from Sri Lanka to Southern Japan over to Hawaii and New South Wales. They inhabit coral reef slopes and lagoons at depths down to 30 metres. Adults will pair off together as mates whereas the juveniles are normally seen on their own. 
   </p><p>
There are no notable differences between the sexes and they currently have not been successful at breeding in captivity however some wild collected larvae has been reared in captivity but it was difficult to adapt them to aquarium foods.
   </p><p>
Once comfortable in the tank these fish have been known to swim up to the top of the water column and take food from its owner's hand.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Saddled Butterflyfish</h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 380 litres as they can grow quite large. Provide them with a substrate mix of sand and coral as well as moderate lighting conditions. They will usually spend their time in open water so provide plenty of swimming areas as well as a few hiding spaces made with live rock. They should be kept in fish-only environments as in a reef setting they will pick at stony corals and invertebrates.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Saddled butterflies are a peaceful species but they will behave territorial towards other members of their own kind. They will do best with non-territorial and less aggressive types of fish. A proven pair can be kept together however they are difficult to obtain so therefore not recommended.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Both large and dwarf species of angelfish will get along great with this species. Batfish, blennies and boxfish will also make excellent choices as tank buddies. Other species that will pair well are cardinals, clownfish and dragonets. Goatfish, gobies and hawkfish are also wonderful options along with parrotfish, puffers and lion fish.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Crustaceans and invertebrates should be chosen carefully as they may get eaten if small enough. Eels, damsels and filefish can sometimes be problematic as well. Other butterflyfish can be kept together as long as they don't look too similar and there is plenty of space in the tank. Scorpions, rays and tangs should also be watched carefully along with triggerfish and some species of wrasse.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
As mentioned before you shouldn't keep these fish with live corals. Groupers and snappers should be avoided too along with any species of shark. Pipefish and seahorses will be too intimidated by the size and boisterous nature of these fish and may be too shy to come out and eat.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Saddled Butterflyfish</h3>
<p>
This species is omnivorous and in the wild will consume a diet of algae, small invertebrates, sponges and fish eggs. In the tank offer them meaty foods such as shrimp as well as flakes and tablets. Nori seaweed will be greatly appreciated as well. Preparations containing algae and sponge matter will work great to mimic their natural diet as much as possible. Feed them at least twice a day as adults and 3-4 times if they are still juveniles.
