  </p><p>
This species is original from the East Atlantic region from Senegal and Cape Verde over to the Gulf of Guinea. They are normally found either in small groups or on their own. They can be found in cooler waters at depths of between 30 and 180 metres.
   </p><p>
Not much is known about their breeding activities due to unsuccessful attempts in captivity but it is thought that they form pairs when it is time for them to procreate.
   </p><p>
These fish have amazing hair-like teeth which. along with their snout nose, they can use to pick out small organisms which are unaccessible to other fish for eating. They can also appear to hover motionlessly when hunting food.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the French Butterflyfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for the French Butterflyfish is 280 litres and it will need plenty of wide open swimming area. They are only suitable to fish-only tanks due to the cooler water that it needs not being able to sustain many types of coral for any lengthy period of time as well as eating a wide variety of corals if they have the chance. They are a deep water fish therefore intense lighting is not advised so keep the lights lowered. Water movement should also be kept moderate but the most important detail in keeping these fish healthy is a stable temperature between 16-19 degrees.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
They are a peaceful species of fish and as such should be housed with other peaceful non-aggressive tank buddies. Only one should be kept in the same tank as they have been seen to fight with others from the same genus. Your biggest challenge will be choosing fish that can survive with the colder temperature requirements of this fish.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Batfish, blennies and boxfish will get along great with this species. Both large and dwarf species of angelfish will also make excellent choices as tank buddies. Other species that will pair well are parrotfish, puffers and lion fish. Goatfish, hawkfish and gobies are also wonderful options along with cardinals, clownfish and dragonets.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Crustaceans and invertebrates should be chosen carefully as they may get eaten if small enough. Scorpions, rays and tangs can sometimes be problematic as well. Other butterflyfish can be kept together as long as they don't look too similar and there is plenty of space in the tank. Eels, damsels and filefish should also be watched carefully along with wrasse and some species of triggerfish.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
As mentioned before you shouldn't keep these fish with live corals. Sharks and groupers should be avoided too along with any species of snappers. Seahorses and pipefish will be too intimidated by the boisterous nature of these fish and may be too shy to come out and eat.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your French Butterflyfish </h3>
<p>
This species in carnivorous and in the wild will feed on small creatures such as Christmas-tree worms, coral polyps and other benthic invertebrates. It may be hard to mimic this in captivity so offer them a meaty diet consisting of brine and frozen mysis shrimp. Black worms will also be greatly appreciated. Feed them several times daily. If you are having problems getting your fish to eat then clams or black mussels still on the half shell may be placed in the tank to elicit a feeding response. Pressing soft foods into the smalls openings of a dead coral skeleton may also help.
