WRASSE-BLUE-THROATED-FAIRY-Cirrhilabrus-cyanogularis

Short Description.
<p>
This species of fairy wrasse is relatively newly defined and gaining popularity in the aquarium trade. Often mistaken for a hybrid of other members of the same species it distinguishes itself from other species in the same family by its strong blue pigmentation especially in the throat area.

Full Description
<p>
The blue throated fairy wrasse has a large flowing fin on top of its body which ranges in colour from a deep red to electric purple.  They can grow to around 5 inches and have a large neon blue patch underneath their chins for which they get their names. 
  </p><p>
These fish are only found near select islands in areas of the Philippines and Indonesia. They can be found around rubble slopes at depths ranging from 4 to 30 metres.
   </p><p>
The females of the species are slightly duller in colouring than their male counterparts. No known success has been reported when attempting to breed this species in captivity.
   </p><p>
They can be quite shy when first introduced to the tank so don't be surprised it they hide for several days before showing their face again. This species doesn't bury itself at night to sleep like other wrasses, instead choosing to cover itself in a mucous cocoon and squeezing themselves inside a rock crevice.

This is a great opportunity to own a fish that hasn't even been fully identified yet. Don't miss out!

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Blue Throated Fairy Wrasse </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species of wrasse is 115 litres. Provide plenty of caves and crevices for them to hide in and explore. A medium grain sand substrate would be perfect and no special lighting or water movement requirements are necessary. These fish are well renowned jumpers so a well fitting aquarium lid is essential to prevent escapes. Egg crates can even be considered to avoid any harm coming to them. They will do well in both a fish only and reef tank environment.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Blue throated fairy wrasse have a peaceful temperament but they will however show aggression to other fairy wrasse. Only one of this species should ever be kept in the same tank at a time.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
This species of wrasse will get along great with large species of angels, boxfish and damsels. Fancy damsels and tangs will also be wonderful choices as tank buddies too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Keep an eye on smaller species of angels, blennies and clownfish. Butterflies, eels and filefish should only be kept together with caution as well. Other species to consider carefully include groupers, grunts and hogfish. Lion fish, parrots and pufferfish should be fine too but be cautious.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Small crustaceans and invertebrates shouldn't be kept in the same tank as they will most likely getting picked at. Another species which should be avoided are batfish. Sharks will almost certainly see the wrasse as prey and docile species such as seahorses and pipefish will get too upset by the wrasse's boisterous nature.
