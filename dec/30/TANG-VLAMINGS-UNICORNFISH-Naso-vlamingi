TANG-VLAMINGS-UNICORNFISH-Naso-vlamingi

Short Description.
<p>
The Vlamings Unicornfish is one of those rare fish that makes every onlooker go 'Wow!'. Not only does it stun you with its impressive size but its colourings are incredible beautiful as well.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
This species has an elongated body with a protruding forehead rather than a horn like other unicorn fish. Adults are normally a greyish brown colour with vertical blue stripes and blue spots on its upper body. It has a blue band running horizontally across its eye and the head is normally an olive green colour.
  </p><p>
They are found in the Indo-Pacific region ranging from Southern Japan to East Africa and the Great Barrier Reef over to New Caledonia. They have been spotted down at depths of 50 metres and normally hang around in small schools but have occasionally been seen on their own. They live around reef drop offs where they can disappear quickly if needed.
   </p><p>
No sexual differences can be seen between the sexes but normally males will be slightly larger. This species of unicorn fish has not yet been bred in captivity but spawning has been reported in some public aquariums.
   </p><p>
Be careful when handling this fish as they have sharp scalpel like spines located on each side which can cause damage accidentally.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Vlamings Unicornfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for these huge specimens is 680 litres or more as they can grow up to 24 inches and they will spend most of their time swimming around wide open spaces. They are not considered reef safe simply for the fact the they may clumsily knock over coral structures when zipping around the tank.They need good strong water movement to help provide well oxygenated water and will happily live in a well lit aquarium. You will need to create some crevices for it to sleep in at night using rocks or other decorations.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
These fish are one of the more peaceful species of tang and will make great additions to most community aquariums. Don't keep them with another of the same species however they can be housed with other tangs of different genus as long as they don't look too similar.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Both large and dwarf species of angelfish will get along great with these guys. Boxfish, clownfish, damsels and eels will also be great tank buddies. Other excellent options include filefish, groupers, parrotfish and puffers. Snappers, wrasse and squirrel fish would make wonderful choices too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Caution should be taken when attempting to house them with species such as rays and triggerfish. Batfish and butterflies can also sometimes be problematic. Cardinals should be watched carefully too.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
As big as the Vlamings Unicornfish can grow, sharks could still take a bite out of them if they wanted so avoid them at all costs. Seahorses and pipefish will probably be extremely frightened in their presence as well so don't attempt to house them in the same tank either.

<h3> Feeding Your Vlamings Unicornfish </h3>
<p>
Juveniles are primarily herbivores and gradually start to consume more and more meat as they progress into adulthood. In the wild they will consume algae until eventually surviving on purely zooplankton and other micro organisms. Start them on on vegetable matter and frozen preparations containing algae and spirulina. Nori seaweed can be attached to a rock or the aquarium glass. As they get older offer them larger shrimp and worms. Feed them 3 times a day in smaller amounts which will help to keep the water quality high.
