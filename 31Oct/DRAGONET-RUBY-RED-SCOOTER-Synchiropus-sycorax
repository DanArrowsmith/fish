Short Description.
<p>
This eye catching species of dragonet will keep you entertained for hours with its stunning colouration and amazing ability to scoot along the bottom substrate.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
The Ruby Red Scooter Dragonet is a fairly new scientific species with a deep red coloured body. It has showy yellow fins and half a black stripe down its back. Along with white patches strewn all over and a yellow belly, these are an extremely handsome species of fish.
  </p><p>
This species has only been found so far around the Jolo Island of the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines. They inhabit areas of coral rubble with nearby outcrops of living stony and soft corals and have been seen at depths of up to 38 metres. Usually found in pairs or on their own.
   </p><p>
The males can be spotted by the appearance of a large and elaborate dorsal fin which they use for moving around and performing mating rituals. Small success has been had when trying to breed this species in captivity. They will rise off the bottom substrate at night and spawn simultaneously, although the offspring are quite slow to develop.
   </p><p>
The Red Ruby Scooter Dragonets scoot around on the bottom substrate due to lacking sufficient swimming fins. It gets its scientific name "sycorax" from the Sycorax Warrior characters in the TV series Dr. Who. They were seen to dress in red cloaks similar to the dragonet's colouring.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Red Ruby Scooter Dragonet </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size required for these fish is 120 litres and will need to be added to an already well established aquarium with sand substrate. Include plenty of rocks for hiding places. No special lighting requirements are needed but a well fitted aquarium lid is a must. Ensure the tank has a sufficiently big enough footprint, i.e plenty of flat bottom area so the dragonet can move around and hunt.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
These fish are a peaceful species and will happily co-exist with others of the same family. Just be sure to add them to the tank at the same time. They are bottom dwellers and as such should not be housed with anything that preys on this type of fish such as anemones.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
They will  get along great with dwarf species of angel fish as well as batfish, boxfish and butterflies. Clownfish, damsels and gobies would make wonderful tank buddies too. Other excellent choices can include hawkfish and tangs. They are perfectly safe to keep along with live corals and the dragonet will not bother seahorses or pipefish either.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Care must be take when attempting to keep with species of rays, puffers and parrotfish. Squirrelfish, wrasse and hogfish may also be problematic too. Filefish, large angelfish and grunts should have a close eye kept on them as well.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Scorpionfish, sharks and snappers should not even be considered as they will see the dragonet as prey. Triggers, lion fish and groupers will also more than likely eat them too. Eels and anglers will see them as a quick snack as well.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Red Ruby Scooter Dragonet</h3>
<p>
These creatures are carnivores and in the wild will actively hunt around for small invertebrates and whatever else it can find. It will thrive in a tank that has a good living sand bed that can provide plenty of natural small invertebrate foods. If supplementing their natural live prey you can feed them small meaty items such as chopped mysis and krill along with vitamin enriched brine shrimp. Be aware that they will need a constant supply of natural live prey as they cannot survive on offered food alone.
