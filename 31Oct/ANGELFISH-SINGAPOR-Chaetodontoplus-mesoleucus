Short Description.
<p>
The Singapore Angelfish is an extremely popular species which is often mistaken for a butterfly fish. Rest assured though that this is an amazing choice for any intermediate aquarium owner.

Full Description
<p>
The first thing you will notice about this fish is its strikingly blue lips and yellow face. It has a distinctive vertical column running down along its eyes. A yellow tail makes for an interesting contrast with its black body which fades into white closer to its face. All this combined with the wavy line patterning and blue tinged fins makes this an impressive creature to look at.
  </p><p>
These fish are found all over the Indo - West Pacific area and love to inhabit reef areas with an abundance of coral between 3 and 15 metres deep. The young are generally found on their own however as they progress into adulthood they are normally found in pairs having mated for life.
   </p><p>
There are no known differences between the 2 sexes and it is extremely difficult to breed this species in captivity. In the wild Singapore Angelfish will normally start the mating process around an hour before sunset with the male performing elaborate rituals by swimming vertically above the female and hanging motionless waiting for her response. 
   </p><p>
The Singapore Angelfish although moderately difficult to maintain is well worth the effort and the patience and will become a prized addition to your tank.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Singapore Angelfish</h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 380 litres and should already be well established and matured with plenty of algae growth present on the rocks. Make sure that it has plenty of hiding spaces as well as at least one area with plenty of light to stimulate natural algae growth. No specific water movement is required however bi weekly water changes are recommended. These fish will do well in a Fish Only With Live Rock tank environment.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
These fish are semi-aggressive and as such should be kept with other semi-aggressive fish and well as peaceful ones. They will fight with other fish that look too similar to them so keep them as singles unless housing in an extremely large tank.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Good tank buddies for this species could include blennies, anglers and clownfish. Eels, damsels, groupers and grunts would also make excellent choices. They should also get along fine with puffers, lion fish and parrotfish. Squirrelfish, tangs and wrasse are perfectly acceptable as well.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Caution should be taken when housing with species of butterflies, especially if they look alike, as they will most probably fight. Batfish, boxfish and filefish may also be problematic. Gobies, triggerfish and dragonets should also be watched carefully. Success can sometimes be had with smaller species of shark. The Singapore Angelfish has also been known to nip at corals, crustaceans and invertebrates so choose them wisely.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Keeping with the same and/or other species of large angelfish will result in aggression.  Rays should also be avoided at all costs as they will not get along at all. Smaller more docile species such as pipefish and seahorses should not even be considered as they will starve to death in the presence of large angelfish like this one.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Singapore Angelfish</h3>
<p>
This species is omnivorous and in the wild will feed on primarily on algae but will also eat sea sponges and other similar creatures. You will need to provide a varied diet of flake, frozen and dried food, but make sure that it has spirulina added to it. They will also enjoy a chomp on fresh/frozen shredded shrimp along with mysis shrimp. Feed them 3 times a day and only reduce this if your aquarium contains an adequate supply of algae growth for them to graze on.
