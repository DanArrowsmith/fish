TANG - SAILFIN	Zebrasoma veliferum
Short Description.
<p>
The beautiful oval shaped Sailfin Tang is often confused with its Indian Ocean cousin and will be just as welcomed into any aquarium due to the ease of keeping them and its stunning vertical stripes.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
The Sailfin Tang is a species of fish that is a sight to behold. The brown disc shaped body has 5 vertical stripes each one with its own intricate set of patterns. It has a vibrant yellow tail fringed with blue highlights and light freckles on its nose. By raising and lowering its fins this fish can seem almost double its original size.
</p><p>
This particular species of tang is originally found all over the Pacific Ocean  from Indonesia to Hawaii through to the Japan and the Great Barrier Reef. They hang around at depths of between 2-30 metres usually in pairs inhabiting lagoons or nearby seaward reefs.
</p><p>
The males are slightly larger than the females and have white hair like bristles. Although they have been know to spawn in aquariums there has been a lack of success when attempting to breed in captivity.
</p><p>
You'll observe them spending most of their time in open areas of the tank. These agile fish love to swim around.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Sailfish Tang</h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 680 litres. They need plenty of swimming space as they are quite a large species of tang.
Provide plenty of places to hide and sleep using coral and rocks. The tang's quick movements may easily topple them so make sure anything you do put is well secured. Sailfish Tangs are grazers and as such will be much happier with live rocks in the tank which they can use for algae consumption.
<p>Arrange at least one area in the tank with strong water movement as they do prefer moderate current from time to time.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Sailfish Tangs will get along with almost anything you put them with and are an extremely mild-mannered species of fish. However only in a sufficiently large enough aquarium should they be kept with other surgeon fish.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
This species will do well with pretty much any other species such as clownfish, damsels, eels and goatfish. They will also get along great with gobies, groupers, hogfish, parrotfish and puffers. Angels, anglers and blennies will make wonderful tank buddies too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
They may get territorial with batfish, butterflies and cardinals so combine them with caution. Some species of rays, triggerfish and squirrelfish may be problematic too. If keeping with different species of tangs ensure that the tank is large enough and add all of the species together to avoid territory disputes.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Seahorses and pipefish are too docile and peaceful and should be avoided altogether as they will be too scared of the tang's boisterous nature to come out and eat. The Sailfin Tang will make great prey for sharks as well so keep those out.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Sailfish Tang </h3>
<p>
These fish are primarily herbivores so provide them plenty of live rock so they can graze on marine algae. They will also do well on vitamin enriched flake and frozen/live food if needed. Feed them small amounts roughly three times a day. In order to maintain a healthy immune system, dried nori seaweed may be attached to rocks to widen their range of vitamin intake and help keep their colours vibrant.
