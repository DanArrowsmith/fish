</p>

Full Description
<p>
These fish have a vivid orange back with a magenta coloured striped that goes along its body all the way to the tail. Their colouring can change depending on what mood they are in and even when performing a mating ritual. The males will develop a dark red crown as they get older.
</p><p>Orange back fairy wrasse are found from depths of 10-25 metres around coral reefs in Sulawesi waters, Indonesia. Often found in small groups along the edge of the reef.
</p><p>
There have been no known cases of breeding this fish in captivity. Also there has been no known sightings of juvenile males so it is thought they all start as females which some will later transform into the males of the species.
</p><p>
You'll enjoy watching these little guys cruising around the aquarium normally high up and quite rapidly. The intense flashes of colouring will keep you entertained for hours along with the tell tale "fairy-like" hovering from which they get their name.
</p><p>These fish sleep in a mucous cocoon that helps guard against predators by disguising their scent so don't be worried if you see them covered in a slime like substance at night.
<p>There is still quite a lot to learn about this fish species as most of them have not been found in open ocean, however they behave similarly to other fairy wrasses in tanks and are a pleasure to keep.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Care should be take with other species of similar looking wrasse. It's a great idea to pair one male with several females as they love to live in a happy harem.. Larger more aggressive fish should be kept with these docile and shy creatures.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Boxfish, angelfish and tangs are a great option to house with the Orange Back Fairy Wrasse. They have been known to get along well with damsels too. 2 or more females of the same species are the preferred choice of tank buddies.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Caution must be take when keeping clownfish, blennies, dwarf angels and frogfish in the same tank.. Parrotfish, dragonettes, goatfish and gobies can also show signs of aggression to these smaller species of wrasse. Snappers, triggerfish and groupers could also be a possibility but again, take care. It is occasionally possible to keep with other species of wrasse as long as they aren't too similar looking.

</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Shy, slow moving fish such as pipefish and seahorses may be left to starve when kept together so avoid those. Other male orange back fairy wrasse will fight each other endlessly. Sharks will most definitely eat them.

</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Orange Back Fairy Wrasse</h3>
<p>
These fish are carnivorous and will thrive on a varied diet of vitamin enriched foods and high quality marine flake and pellets. They love meaty food such as mysis or brine shrimp. Feed them smaller amounts 3-4 times a day and ensure lots of variety which will help keeps their colouring nice and vibrant.
