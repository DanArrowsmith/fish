Full Description
<p>
Talbot's Damselfish come in a range of pink to dark purple body colouring with an extremely distinctive painted yellow face. To confuse predators they have a black eye spot located near the dorsal fin which helps it to avoid attacks from the front. Although quite small in size, it is a very active swimmer and will eat almost anything you offer it.

These fish are originally from the Western Pacific region from Fiji all the way to the Andaman Sea. They are also found in abundance dotted around the Australia and the Great Barrier Reef. Inhabiting deep reef areas as well as shallower water such as bays and lagoons, they will hover around all areas with plenty of coral growth and sometimes even close to the bottom substrate at depths of up to 35 metres.
   </p><p>
There are no known differences between males and females however the males are generally thought to be the larger sex. It is quite difficult to breed this species in captivity due to the complications of rearing the larvae and raising the smaller juveniles. It can be done however but care must be taken only to attempt in large dedicated tank without predators.
   </p><p>
Talbot's Damselfish are the least aggressive type of damsel and will spend their spend in the lower areas of your aquarium and will rarely get territorial as long as tank requirements are met making these fish a great addition to any reef tank.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Talbot's Damselfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size required for this species of damsel is 75 litres. They will need you to provide plenty of areas for them to hide such as crevices and caves which can be created with coral and live rock. Sand substrate is also an excellent choice which will allow them to bury themselves if needed when they feel threatened. This species will enjoy aquarium setups with any kind of lighting or water movement.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Talbot's Damselfish will be easily bullied by more aggressive species and will get along much better with passive and peaceful fish. Predatory fish will almost certainly prey on your damsel however these fish do extremely well in a reef environment and will leave your live coral and invertebrates well alone.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
It's extremely easy to keep Talbot's Damselfish together as a pair and even as a small group as long as more tank space is added for each fish. They will do well with more docile species such as boxfish, blennies and dragonets. Both large and small angelfish can also be kept successfully together. Crustaceans, gobies, and parrotfish would make a wonderful choice too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Batfish, butterflies and cardinals may bully the damsel from time to time so keep an eye out for that if housing with these species. Other species of damsels and fancy damsels sometimes can be problematic due to territory disputes.  They may also get picked on a little by triggers, grunts and filefish.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Larger predatory fish such as eels, sharks and groupers will most certainly eat your damselfish so avoid keeping these together. Scorpions and snappers will also be a problem. The damselfish will outcompete docile creatures such as pipefish and seahorses for food and allow them to starve.

<h3> Feeding Your Talbot's Damselfish </h3>
<p>
These fish are omnivorous and in the wild will feed primarily on zooplankton and occasionally vegetable matter such as algae and as such require a wide variety of foods when kept in captivity. They will love all kinds of meaty food such as shrimp, minced fish and varied types of omnivore pre-preparations. This can be given as frozen, fresh and flake but a great option is sinking pellets. These will sink to the bottom of the tank where the damsels like to stay and provide easy access and less competition. Blanched vegetables and herbivore preparations should also be given to make around 50% of their dietary intake. Feeding them smaller amounts several times a day would be best.
