WRASSE FLASHER YELLOW FIN Paracheilinus flavianalis

Short Description.
<p>
This show stopper of a fish is incredible for many reasons. The male will display electric blue colouring which it will "flash" in a mating ritual to nearby females. There is always excitement when you have a Yellowfin Flasher Wrasse in your tank.

Full Description
<p>
The adult males of this this species are by far the most impressive. They are a vivid orange colour with subtle streaks of blue in various areas. A number of long, orange filaments hang from its back which it uses to flash yellow and white along with neon blue stripes during a stunning display of prowess. Females are a redder shade without the longer fins and filaments. They may have a faint violet streak along the underside.
  </p><p>
Yellowfin Flasher Wrasse are originally found in small groups all over the East Indian Ocean from Australia through to Indonesia. They inhabit shallow crests near sheltered reefs which can drop down to 40 metres. 
   </p><p>
If females are included in the tank plenty of breeding behaviour will be displayed. Spawning has been noticed however no known success has been had when rearing them in captivity.
   </p><p>
These fish, especially the males, will dart around the tank and provide plenty of entertainment with their courtship displays. They truly are a sight to behold even when sleeping at night in their self-made mucous covered cocoons.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Yellowfin Flasher Wrasse </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 210 litres and the wrasse with require plenty of wide open swimming space so a longer rather than taller tank is advised. If keeping with larger fish provide plenty of rocks where the wrasse can hide and dart in and out of.
Remember that this fish enjoys long horizontal spaces so be sure not to block its path. Even though this type of wrasse is not a jumper it can sometimes frighten other fish with its energetic behaviour so be sure to install a well fitting aquarium lid to avoid losing anyone over the side. Flasher wrasses do not sleep in the sand unlike other species so substrate type is unimportant.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The yellowfin flasher wrasse will get along great with mostly every other species as long as they are not large predators. They can be kept in schools as long as tank size is sufficient however only 1 male is recommended with multiple females. Keeping more than one male together will require an extremely large aquarium to avoid aggression.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Boxfish and tangs will have no problems being kept with this type of wrasse. They will also get along great with larger species of angelfish.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Larger predators such as lions, eels and groupers can sometimes prey upon the wrasse but not always. Parrotfish, rays and hogfish should be watched carefully too. There can sometimes be conflicts with clownfish and dwarf angels. Gobies, grunts and dragonets will have to be monitored also.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Sharks will see the wrasse as food and will without a doubt eat them. Pipefish and seahorse may be too intimidated by the wrasse's erratic behaviour and be too scared to come out and eat.

<h3> Feeding Your Yellowfin Flasher Wrasse </h3>
<p>
This species are carnivorous and in they wild will survive on a diet of zooplankton. You should feed them a good variety of vitamin enriched brine and mysis shrimp as well as other meaty foods. They will also consume high quality marine pellet and flake foods designed for carnivores.
These fish have small stomachs and as such need to be fed very frequently. 2-3 times a day should be fine but be aware they will steal food from slower moving fish so always feed your wrasse first.
