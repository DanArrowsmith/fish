<p>
This shy nocturnal fish is well worth staying up late for. An impressive member of the squirrelfish family these guys would make a an excellent addition to many types of aquariums.

Full Description
<p>
These red coloured squirrelfish have silver-white horizontal stripes running along their bodies as well as a vertical one running down both the gill cover and through the eye. They have spines on their heads and gills which can cause a nasty wound if they are not handled correctly.
  </p><p>
The Crown Squirrelfish are originally from the Indian and West Pacific Oceans mainly in the Red Sea and East Africa but also as far east as Australia and Japan. They are nocturnal creatures and will hide in crevices located in reefs and lagoons during daylight hours in small schools. They've been spotted down at depths to 60 metres.
   </p><p>
Even though it is easy to keep two or more of these species in the same tank together it is extremely unlikely that they will breed in a captive setting.
   </p><p>
Crown squirrelfish has a venomous spine which normally poses no threat to the aquarium owner however it you do come into contact with it seek medical help as each person can react differently to toxins.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Crown Squirrelfish</h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size that we recommend for this species of squirrelfish is 280 litres as even though they are one of the smaller types of its family they can still grow relatively large. The aquarium should be dimly lit as they are nocturnal creatures and suitable hiding places such as caves and overhangs should be created to allow them to sleep. They will thrive in both reef and fish only tank settings. Be aware that they are extremely sensitive to the aquarium panels being tapped against and will become stressed easily if this happens.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Although this is classified as a peaceful species of fish it will hunt smaller species of fish, crustaceans and invertebrates. They are best kept in small shoal as long as enough tank space is provided.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
The Crown Squirrelfish will not harm your live corals and will live peacefully with other species of squirrelfish as well as tangs and rays. Other wonderful choices for tank buddies can include puffers, parrotfish and grunts. Boxfish, batfish and angelfish would be great options too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Care should be taken when attempting to keep them with crustaceans, damsels and invertebrates. Dragonets, scorpions and wrasse should also be approached with caution too. Success has been has with species of shark and triggerfish as long as they are watched for signs of aggression or predatory behaviour.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
The smaller, slow moving docile species such as pipefish and seahorses will more than likely get preyed upon so don't even consider keeping them together. Groupers and snappers are best left out of aquariums containing squirrelfish as well.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Crown Squirrelfish </h3>
<p>
These are carnivorous fish and are great at consuming any fire/bristle worms that are present in your tank. They will need a diet of meaty foods such as mysis and brine shrimp, chopped shrimp or fish flesh and other meat preparations. Feed them 2 -3 times a day and be aware that it may take a while for them to start accepting frozen food. In the meantime live guppies, worms and shrimps can be offered until they get used to the frozen preparations being offered to other fish in the tank.
