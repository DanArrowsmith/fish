TANG - CHOCOLATE	Acanthurus pyroferus

Short Description.
<p>
The Chocolate Tang is an excellent choice for an aquarium not only due to it being one of the easiest tangs to maintain but also the dramatic transformation as it changes from juvenile to adult.

Full Description
<p>
As adults these fish have a disc shaped yellow to dark brown and purple bodies with an intense orange patch located on its chest area. A dark band outlines the bottom half of its face and its tail is fringed with yellow. As juveniles the colouration varies dramatically. The will mimic the colouring and markings of nearby dwarf angelfish which is thought to help protect them from predators and also allow them to feed closer to territorial damselfish who seem to tolerate an angelfish's presence better than the tang's. 
  </p><p>
This species of tang is originally found all over the Indo-Pacific area and can be frequently seen in the Seychelles, Japan and even Tuamotu. The adults will enjoy life on their own around shallow lagoons and reef slopes that offer plenty of rock, coral and sand around the bottom. They have been seen at depths of up to 60 metres. The juveniles on the other hand will form small groups which offer protection when venturing out of hiding to feed.
   </p><p>
It is extremely difficult to differentiate between the sexes of this species and as such no known success has been had when attempting to breed them in captivity however some spawning has been noticed in public aquariums.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Chocolate Tang </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species of tang is 280 litres as even though they are relatively small they still require loads of wide open swimming space. Sufficient rocks and coral areas that will provide zones for hiding and sleeping at night are essential. At least one area of the tank should have strong water movement as these guys love well oxygenated water and the feeling of it running through its gills. They will thrive in both a fish only and reef aquarium setting and will graze on algae so live rock would be a perfect choice.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
These are one of the more peaceful species of tang available and multiple juveniles can be kept together for a while. However they will need to be separated soon as when the tangs grow older they will show signs of aggression to other tangs. They will do fine with other large more aggressive species.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Filefish, groupers and grunts would make great additions as tank buddies. Other excellent choices could include boxfish, angelfish and frogfish. The Chocolate Tang will also get along fine with lion fish, puffers and parrotfish.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Watch out for signs of bullying if keeping with triggerfish, butterflies and cardinals. Rays and batfish should also have a close eye kept on them if housing with the Chocolate Tang. As with most species of surgeonfish they will be aggressive and fight with other members of the same family.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Seahorses and pipefish will more than likely be too docile and frightened to venture out and eat with the presence of a tang in the tank so are best avoided. Sharks would make a horrible choice of tank buddy and will normally eat the tang the first chance it gets.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Chocolate Tang</h3>
<p>
These fish are omnivorous but will live primarily as herbivores and as such will thrive on a varied diet consisting of vegetable matter. They are constant eaters and will actively graze in a tank that provides plenty of algae. They do however need some meaty foods so in addition to this provide small amounts of mysis and/or brine shrimp and flake foods occasionally. If insufficient algae growth isn't maintained dried sheets of nori seaweed may be fixed to a rock or glass.
