DAMSELFISH - WHITE TAIL HUMBUG	Dascyllus aruanus

Short Description.
<p>
The White Tail Damselfish is an extremely handsome species with a fiery personality. A great starter fish due to their relatively inexpensive cost and aquarium hardiness.

Full Description
<p>
These interesting looking creatures have a white body with exactly 3 vertical black stripes running down it. One through the eye and two more along its body, leaving the nose and tail white which explains why it also goes by the name of the Humbug Damsel. This species is often confused with the similarly patterned 4 stripe damsel which is almost identical apart from its fourth black stripe covering the tail.
  </p><p>
This species of damselfish is originally found all over the Indo-Pacific region and the Red Sea from Japan all the way down to Australia. As juveniles they swim together in large groups but progressing into adulthood split off solely to inhabit its own personal territory. They prefer shallow lagoons and reef faces at depths of up to 12 metres.
   </p><p>
The males of this species are usually the largest of a pair or small group. All White Tail Damselfish are born female and in the absence of a male the most dominant female will transform. Success has been had with breeding this species in captivity however it is very difficult due to the fact that the eggs are extremely small and require perfect water parameters.
   </p><p>
White Tail Damsels are a great addition not only for their distinctive markings but also for their ability to produce pulsing sounds when fighting or displaying courtship routines. These clicks and pops will keep you surprised and entertained for hours.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the White Tail Damselfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 120 litres and they will do well in all kinds of aquarium settings. They will need areas of live rock or coral in which to hide and establish territory as they mature. Keep in mind that this species isn't very able bodied and you must leave sufficient room for them to manoeuvre around. Any kind of substrate is acceptable along with lighting conditions. The juveniles will normally stay hovering around the top of the tank before becoming adults and finding their own place in the rock work so be sure to not overcrowd the upper area of the water column.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
This is an aggressive little species of fish and as such should only be kept with other semi-aggressive or larger species. Only one White Tail Damselfish per tank is recommended however a male-female pair may be housed together but be aware this will increase aggression towards other tank buddies.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Large angelfish, boxfish and clownfish would make an excellent choice of species to keep together with these fish. Other great options for tank buddies could include parrotfish, tangs and puffers. Hogfish, hawkfish and gobies will hold their own with the damsel as well.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Frogfish, triggerfish and rays may be kept with this species however caution should be taken. Other species such as filefish, cardinals and butterflies should also be watched carefully if added to the tank. Batfish, grunts and squirrelfish can also be problematic occasionally. 
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Larger predators such as eels, groupers and sharks should be avoided at all costs as they will eat your handsome new damsel. Snappers and scorpionfish are also terrible choices for the same reason. Passive slow moving species such as seahorses and pipefish should not be considered either.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your White Tail Damselfish</h3>
<p>
This species of damsels is omnivorous and in the wild will have a diet that consists of algae, micro crustaceans and even fish eggs. Try to mimic its 50/50 plant and meat diet by providing mysis and brine shrimp, krill and minced fish flesh along with herbivore pellets and flakes. Feed them twice a day however this can be reduced if a lot of algae is already present in your tank.
