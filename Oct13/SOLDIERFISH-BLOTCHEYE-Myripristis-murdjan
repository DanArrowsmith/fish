Short Description.
<p>

Full Description
<p>
The Blotcheye Soldier fish has a red to silver like pink colouring on its body and can grown up to 30 centimetres. Their huge eyes help them to see in the dark as they are mostly nocturnal creatures and feed at night. It gets its name from the distinctive black irregular mark that runs directly through its eyes.
  </p><p>
Originally these fish come from the Indo - West Pacific area ranging from Australia and Japan over the the Red Sea and Indonesia. They hang around in outer reefs and lagoons between 10 - 40 metres deep. Preferring to stay in dark places during daylight they can be found upside down hovering in caves hiding from the light and predators.
   </p><p>
No known differences are noted between the males and females and no success has been obtained when attempting to breed this species in captivity. Very little is known about their breeding habits.
   </p><p>
Blotcheye Soldierfish have been known to be quite vocal and you may occasionally hear them grunting and clicking for reasons which we are still not sure about. Although quite a secretive species, once they feel at home in your tank you will start to see them become more active especially when the lights are dimmed.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Blotcheye Soldierfish </h3>
<p>
These fish can grow relatively large so a tank size of 800 litres is advised. They require a cave or sheltered overhang in which they can hide out and sleep during the day.
In the wild this species is not used to excessive light so its best to acclimatise them slowly by starting with dim lighting and gradually in increasing it to a normal level.
They can be kept in a reef setting with some caution and will do equally well in a fish only aquarium.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The Blotcheye Soldierfish is a mostly peaceful species however it can get aggressive towards other species of squirrelfish. 
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Multiple specimens of this species can be kept together as long enough tank space and shelter is provided and they are added to the tank at the same time. They will get along fine with angels, boxfish and batfish. Clownfish, hogfish and puffers would also be a great choice for tank buddies. Other excellent options include rays, parrotfish and filefish.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
The Blotcheye Soldierfish has been known to prey upon certain types of invertebrates so chose them carefully. Eels, damsels and lion fish should also be only added into the tank with caution. Some success has also been had with sharks, scorpions and triggerfish too as long as a close watch is kept on them.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Snappers and groupers should not even be considered when selecting other fish to keep with this species. Pipefish and seahorses also should not be housed with them due to the possibility of feeding problems.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Blotcheye Surgeonfish </h3>
<p>
This species is carnivorous and in the wild will feed upon a variety of things such as large plankton, small crustaceans and small fish. In your home aquarium you should provide them a diet which mimics this as much as possible. Try them with meaty preparations and live food along with thawed foods such as crab, krill and even mysis shrimp.
