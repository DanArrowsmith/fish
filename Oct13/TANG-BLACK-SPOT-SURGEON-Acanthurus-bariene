Full Description
<p>
As these fish mature into adulthood they develop deep blue, brown and black colouration accented with a bright tangerine orange covering the fins, eyes and various other areas. The electric blue outline combined with characteristic black spot on the tail really make this fish pop. They have sharp spines which point forward which only come out when the fish is excited or stressed so be extremely careful when trying to handle them
  </p><p>
This species of surgeon fish is originally found in the Indo West- Pacific region ranging from the Maldives and Indonesia all the way over to Mozambique. They prefer reef slopes and have been known to venture down to 30 metres deep.
   </p><p>
These fish are hard to find in the aquarium trade and as such breeding has not really been experimented with to any extent. 
   </p><p>
Be aware that the juvenile colouring is not quite as impressive and slightly muted. Don't worry though with proper care and attention they will grow into the stunning species of tang that is so highly sought after.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Black Spot Surgeonfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size required for this species of tang is 1300 litres which sounds like a lot but believe us, the black spot surgeonfish needs an enormous amount of wide open swimming area when fully grown. Plenty of live rock should also be provided to give the fish areas to shelter and hide.They will thrive in both fish only and reef settings. Some water movement is essential as they are at their best in well oxygenated tanks however substrate choice should not be a concern,
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
This species is mostly peaceful however will fight with its own and other species of surgeonfish so oly 1 per tank is advised. It should be kept with other peaceful non nipping tank buddies to avoid causing stress. 
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Angels, frogfish and boxfish would make excellent choices for tank buddies. Other great additions could include species such as filefish, groupers and grunts. This species of tang will also do well with parrotfish, puffers and lion fish and can even be kept with invertebrates.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Batfish, butterflies and cardinals should be watched carefully for signs of bullying if keeping with the Black Spot Surgeonfish. Other species to keep a close eye on include rays and triggerfish. As mentioned before they will more than likely show signs of aggression when housed with other species of tangs.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Sharks are definitely out of the question as they will actively prey on this species of tang. Docile slow moving fish such as pipefish and seahorses should also be avoided as they will be too scared of the tang's boisterous nature to come out and eat.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Black Spot Surgeonfish</h3>
<p>
These fish are omnivorous grazers and as such are excellent at controlling the algae population in your tank. They will consume meaty foods however it is more beneficial to supplement their diet with a variety of vegetation such as spirulina, broccoli, dried nori and even vegetable flakes. This will strengthen their immune system and help reduce aggression. Feed them at least twice a day depending on the amount of naturally occurring algae in your aquarium.
