Full Description
<p>
This species of triggerfish range from a deep purple colouring through to dark and light blue shades. They also have the ability to change colour depending on their mood and environment. Its distinctive protruding chin can make it seem quite threatening however it is one of the most peaceful species of triggerfish.
  </p><p>
Red Tooth Triggerfish are found all over the Indo-Pacific region as well as the Red Sea. They can be found at depths of up to 30 metres from the Great Barrier Reef all the way over to South Africa. Normally the will hide in crevices to avoid getting swept away however they have been seen forming large schools in order to feed on zooplankton that gets swept in by currents.
   </p><p>
There are no visible differences between male and females however in the wild they will form distinct pairs with the males establishing territory and guarding the eggs after the female has laid them. No success has been had when trying to breed this species in an aquarium setting.
   </p><p>
The Red Tooth Triggerfish has a unique swimming style that uses its rear fins in a propeller like motion which lets this species move around extremely easily.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Red Tooth Triggerfish </h3>
<p>
These fish can grow quite large so a minimum tank size of 680 litres is advised. They will generally adapt to most settings with no specific lighting or water movement requirements. Provide some patches of rock for shelter and rest along with plenty of open space to move around and grow. They are safe with corals however as mentioned they love to swim around and will destroy a reef setting if it is too crowded.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Being one of the more peaceful species of triggerfish they can be kept with a large variety of other species. However as it grows bigger it may become more aggressive and each fish may be different. One could get along fine with everyone while a different trigger may terrorise their tank buddies so exercise caution and keep an eye on them.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Red Tooth Triggerfish will not harm your live coral intentionally and are normally friendly towards any other species, but at the end of the day they are still triggerfish and as such can turn at any moment so there is no guarantee with any fish species whether they will get along or not.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
If watched carefully for signs of aggression these fish can be kept with species such as large and dwarf angelfish, boxfish and butterflies. Groupers, grunts and puffers may be acceptable tank buddies also as long as they are observed in case of fighting. Success can sometimes be had when combining with parrotfish, lions, tangs and even other triggerfish. 
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Crustaceans and invertebrates will more than likely get eaten so avoid keeping them in the same tank unless intentionally providing them as food. Seahorses and pipefish will not feed with a species such as this present in the tank. Bigger predators such as sharks should not be considered either.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Red Tooth Triggerfish </h3>
<p>
This fish is an omnivore and in the wild will feed on zooplankton and pretty much anything else it can get its mouth on. In the aquarium their diet will mostly be carnivorous and they will love meaty foods such as krill and thawed mysis or brine shrimp. Offer them dried pellets and flakes as well to maintain vitamin intake. Feed them 2-3 times a day but take care as they have been known to bite the hand that feeds them and trust us, it's painful!
