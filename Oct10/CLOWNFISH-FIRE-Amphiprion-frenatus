CLOWNFISH  FIRE Amphiprion frenatus

Short Description.
<p>
The fire clownfish is one of the easiest clownfish to take care of due to its hardy nature which makes it an excellent choice for beginner aquarium owners to 'get their Nemo on'!

Full Description
<p>
The colouring of these clownfish can range from tomato red to vibrant orange and the males of the species will generally maintain this brightness all the way through adulthood. The females however will darken with age turning a slightly brown shade on the side. The most distinguishing feature has to be the white vertical stripe running through its head. The juveniles actually start with three bands that will gradually fade into one predominant one.

This particular species of clownfish are originally found in the Western Pacific Ocean from Palau, Japan and Indonesia across to the Gulf of Thailand. The inhabit shallow lagoon reefs and bays at depths of up to 12 metres. Usually they will live inside a host Bubble Tip Anemone in adult male-female pairs while the juveniles live solitary lives.
   </p><p>
These are one of the easiest species of clownfish to breed in captivity and great success has been had in both the hatching and rearing of juveniles. What is interesting about these creatures is that they are all born sexless and will change into juvenile males based on social and environmental cues. The most dominant male will then transform into a female when the absence of one is apparent.
   </p><p>
The Fire Clownfish has a symbiotic relationship with the Bubble Tip Anemone. The anemone provides shelter from predators due to the clownfish's seemingly immunity of its stinging tentacles and in return the clownfish will protect it from fish that prey on anemones.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Fire Clownfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for a single clownfish is 115 litres but at least 160 is required when keeping as a pair. If an anemone is added 180 litres is recommended however these do come with their own set of requirements so think carefully before introducing it.
Anemones are not essential to the survival of this species and in the absence of one, live rock, coral or other structures can be substituted. Lighting and water movement are not an issue however be sure to maintain at least one calmer area of the tank for feeding. Any substrate type is acceptable and the fire clownfish will tend to stay in the same vicinity of its host anemone/coral/rock only leaving it to feed and chase away other fish.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
These fish can be very territorial and aggressive and as such should be kept with species that can hold their own against it. They will attack other clownfish and their own species so unless they are a proven pair keep them on their own.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Fire clownfish will do well with large and dwarf species of angelfish. Batfish, boxfish and filefish will get along fine with them too. Other good options to keep with them include tangs, parrotfish and grunts. Fire clownfish can be housed with live coral and will only occasionally nip at them to clean the algae from around its base.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Caution must be taken when attempting to keep fire clownfish with species such as puffers, triggerfish and wrasse. Success can sometimes be had when housing with pipefish and seahorses however the tank must be large enough to have sufficiently spaced territories. Frogfish should watched carefully in case they get big enough to fit the clownfish in its mouth.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Larger predators such as groupers, eels and lion fish should not even be considered as they will prey upon your beautiful new clownfish. Sharks, snappers and scorpions will also most likely see them as dinner too.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Fire Clownfish </h3>
<p>
These fish are omnivores and in the wild will feed on algae, copepods, small crustaceans and even fish eggs. In the tank you will need to provide them a diet of 50/50 plant and meaty foods. They may feed on some of the algae in your aquarium but should be provided with pellets and flake foods that contain spirulina. Meaty options can include brine and mysis shrimp, fresh or thawed marine preparations and minced fish or shrimp flesh. Be sure to feed them 3-4 times daily with roughly the amount they can consume in about 3 minutes.
