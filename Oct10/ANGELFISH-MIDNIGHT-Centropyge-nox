ANGELFISH - MIDNIGHT	Centropyge nox

Short Description.
<p>
Even though at first glance this all-black species of dwarf angelfish may seem kinda dull, but once you see the contrast its colouring makes against the other inhabitants of your tank you'll understand why this popular fish is such a superstar.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
This species is quite easy to identify being one of the only few species of fish that is uniformly black all over its entire body. Even though it can reach a size of up to 5 inches it is still classified as a dwarf species of angelfish.
  </p><p>
They are found all over the East Indian - Western Pacific region from Komodo and Japan all the way over to Western Australia, Tonga and the Togean Islands. They have been spotted at depths down to 70 metres and love hanging around rocky outcrops and other coral rich areas. Midnight angelfish are often found on their own or in pairs. 
   </p><p>
There are no visible differences between males and females of this species which could explain the high level of difficulty in breeding them in captivity.
   </p><p>
These dwarf angelfish are considered one of the more peaceful species and will certainly stand out from the bright colouration of most fish species and coral in a typical marine tank making these coal coloured creatures an excellent addition to your aquarium.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Midnight Angelfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species of fish is 115 litres and due to being relatively shy initially should be kept in a tank with plenty of hiding spaces. Live rock is important and must be arranged in a thoughtful manner that will create overhangs and caves which they can swim through. Noxious corals can be added however this fish will more than likely pick at a variety of things in a normal reef setting. 
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The Midnight Angelfish is one of the least aggressive of its type and as such will do best when kept with other peaceful - semi-aggressive fish species. Although they can be housed with other dwarf angels, a large enough tank should be provided to avoid territory disputes and all species should be added at the same time.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
This species of dwarf angelfish will not bother invertebrates like crabs, snails and shrimp and generally will not nip at soft corals. Larger species of angel fish, blennies and butterflyfish will get along with them fine. Other good choices of tank buddies include clownfish, damsels, filefish and grunts. Parrotfish, puffers and tangs would be another great option too.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
As mentioned before other types of live coral must be chosen extremely carefully along with certain species of invertebrates. Sometimes all these fish need is to "try" a new food source and will end up ultimately destroying it so be prepared to remove anything that the angelfish has taken an interest in. Caution should also be taken when housing with lion fish, groupers and frogfish especially the bigger ones. Batfish, eels and wrasse must also be watched carefully too.

</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Seahorses and pipefish will be too scared to come out and eat in the presence of this fish and may stave to death. Sharks will almost certainly see the angelfish as prey and should not even be considered when choosing tank buddies for these guys.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Midnight Angelfish</h3>
<p>
This species is omnivorous and in the wild feeds on a diet consisting mainly of algae and crustaceans. You should provide a well balanced diet containing all the necessary vitamins in order to mimic this and maintain a healthy immune system. High quality angelfish preparations and spirulina along with mysis or brine shrimp, krill and other meaty items would be ideal. Feed them two to three times a day, roughly the amount it can consume in a minute or two, along with providing plenty of areas to graze on live rock between feedings.
