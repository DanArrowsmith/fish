SNAIL - STROMB	Strombus sp.

Short Description.
<p>
With their typical "seashell" like shell the Stromb Snail is excellent at cleaning your sand substrate. If you're looking for a snail with a personality then look no further!

</p>

Full Description
<p>
There are various different varieties of Stromb Snails however all of them posses the iconic conch shaped shell that beach goers will pick up and press against their ear to listen to the ocean. They have beady stemmed eyes which seem to watch your every move along with an impressive trunk like mouth which they use to suck up algae, bacteria and anything else they can find coating the sand.
  </p><p>
These types of snails are found all over the Indo-Pacific region and sadly are prized not only for food but also their shells. Luckily however they are extremely easy to breed in captivity. Unlike most species of snails the females differentiate from the males. If tipped on their sides an egg groove can be noticed on the female when she tries to right herself. Similarly a verge can be observed on the males.
   </p><p>
They are extremely active creatures and will entertain you by moving around the tank all day in search of food. They have an extremely powerful foot which can be used to defend itself by hopping away at quite a speed as well as tipping itself back over if needed..

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Stromb Snail </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for 1 snail is 90 litres and if the tank is already well established with lots of algae existing in the substrate then even better. Provide more space and watch your snail grow even larger. They require a silt or sand substrate which is deep enough for them to bury themselves completely and disappear. They are suitable for all types of marine aquariums including reef environments.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Stromb snails can be kept with pretty much any other type of creature and will not show signs of aggression. If keeping with another male stromb snail they can sometimes fight however it is simply pushing around and not really harming anyone.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Tangs, scorpions, damsels and dragonets will leave them well alone. Cardinals and clownfish will not even notice the presence of the snails either. These snails can also be kept with other stromb snails as long as tank capacity is considered. As mentioned, they will not bother coral or other invertebrates.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Even with the ability to right itself when knocked over, care must still be taken when keeping the snails with lion fish, rays and snapper. Frogfish, angel fish and crustaceans should also be housed with caution as they could use the opening in the shell to try and eat the snail. Seahorses and pipefish are peaceful however the snail may not care too much and trample all over their feeding areas.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
There are a few species of fish that will hunt the stromb snail including parrotfish, triggerfish, sharks and puffers. Hogfish, wrasse and eels should be avoided too.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Stromb Snail </h3>
<p>
This species of snail is an omnivore however in the tank its diet should consist of algae, detritus and bacteria that exists already in the substrate. They have a tooth like tongue which will even scrape algae from the surfaces in your aquarium. They do require a large amount of food so if there is insufficient algae growth then it is possible to supplement their diet with herbivore pellets and dried seaweed. Stromb snails will also consume anything left over from feeding other tank buddies.
