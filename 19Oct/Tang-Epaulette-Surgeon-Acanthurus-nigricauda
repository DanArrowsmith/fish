Tang - Epaulette Surgeon Acanthurus nigricauda

Short Description.
<p>
The Epaulette Surgeonfish is in three words big, bold and beautiful. They are the prized attraction in any suitably large enough tank and a sight to behold.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
This large species of tang has a blueish grey compressed body with black bands that run from behind the eye half way down the body. Its crescent shaped tail fin also has black bars extending from it in the opposite direction. They have the ability to quickly change shades when signalling aggression or courtship behaviour.
  </p><p>
The Epaulette Surgeonfish is originally found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans from Africa to the Tuamoto Islands across to Japan and parts of Australia. They inhabit reef slopes and lagoons usually staying near the sandy bottoms and have been seen at depths down to around 30 metres. They will normally form schools and live peacefully among each other in the wild.
   </p><p>
Tangs are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity but it is thought that in the wild that will pair off together to spawn.
   </p><p>
Due to their size this species is a rare addition to an aquarium but well worth it. It will flash its different shades of colouring when it is receptive to cleaner fishes which means if one is present in the tank you're in a for a show. Be careful though as they have sharp  retractable scalpels which they can use to slash at rival fish and protect itself against bigger predators.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Epaulette Surgeonfish</h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for these fish is 680 litres as they can grow extremely large. They do like to establish territories so include plenty of live rock but leave enough swimming area as they will move around a lot. They prefer good water movement and excellent filtration. This species is suitable for both fish only with live rock and reef aquarium settings.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
This species is quite big and as such can hold its own with most other species. They school naturally in the wild however should only be kept in singles in a captive environment.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Good choices of tank buddies can include angelfish, boxfish, clownfish and even eels. The Epaulette Surgeonfish will also get along great with dragonettes, groupers, gobies and grunts. Hogfish, parrot fish, lions and puffers would be wonderful additions too. Other suitable options are snappers and squirrelfish. This species will co-exist perfectly with live coral, invertebrates and crustaceans.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Keep an eye out if housing with batfish and butterflies as they sometimes wont be compatible. Cardinals and some species of rays can be problematic too. Depending on the size, triggers can be kept together with caution. They can sometimes show aggression to other species of surgeonfish and tangs especially if they look very similar. 
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Even though this is quite a large species of fish, attempting to keep sharks in the same tank will most likely result in disaster. Shy and docile species such as pipefish and seahorses should not be considered either.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Epaulette Surgeonfish</h3>
<p>
These fish are omnivores and in the wild will graze on algae. In the aquarium however they will consume meaty foods that are offered to the other fish. It is still important though that you also provide them with marine based vegetation such as algae from live rock and seaweed. Japanese nori sheets can be tied to rocks or clipped to other surfaces about three times a week to ensure sufficient vitamin intake and to maintain a functioning immune system.
