LIONFISH - ZEBRA HAZ Dendrochirus zebra

Short Description.
<p>
The striking colouration of the Zebra Lion Fish doesn't only just serve as a warning to potential predators, it will fascinate you day in and day out.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
The Zebra Lion Fish has black, orange and white vertical stripes running along its body along with huge pectoral fins which it fans out on each side while laying on the sand. It also has a multitude of spines which are extremely venomous.
  </p><p>
This fish originate from all over the Indo-Pacific area from the Red Sea to Australia and also including Japan. It is found at depths of up to 80 metres dwelling on the bottom of coral reef flats and lagoons. They prefer a solitary life but have been observed hunting in groups of 2 or more.
   </p><p>
It is possible to breed this species in captivity however it isn't easy and not advised for the novice aquarist. Seek help from an expert when attempting to spawn and reproduce.
   </p><p>
The Zebra Lion Fish isn't a very active swimmer and moves fairly slowing which when combined with its small size makes it a great choice for lion fish first timers. It even made an appearance in the Animal Crossing game franchise and has been known to become quite tame in captivity to the point of actually recognising their owners.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Zebra Lion Fish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for these lion fish is 150 litres and you should be careful to avoid having a tank environment that is too brightly lit. They will more than likely suffer stress when extremely strong lighting is present. Try to mimic its natural environment as much as possible by providing some cave like structures along with rocky overhangs and outcrops. It is best suited to a fish only tank but can be kept in a reef setting with caution.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
They are best kept with other more aggressive species of fish because the shy docile ones will have a hard time with it. Be aware that they will try to eat almost anything that is small enough to fit inside its mouth so take care when selecting tank buddies, even other lion fish.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Big groupers, puffers, snappers and angelfish would make great choices as tank mates as long as they are bigger in size than the lion fish. Take care that your lion fish doesn't outgrow then. Live coral, cucumbers and starfish will be left alone and other lion fish will be fine too, as long as there is sufficient space for them in the tank.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Appropriately sized rays and sharks can be kept together however be aware they can sometimes prey on the lion fish regardless of its spines. Invertebrates and crustaceans will be preyed upon if they are small enough so choose them carefully if attempting to house with this type of lion fish.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
All small species of fish both slow moving and fast ones will be prey so don't add anything like seahorses and damsels, etc. Frog fish will definitely hunt them so avoid at all costs too.
</p>


<h3> Feeding Your Zebra Lion Fish</h3>
<p>
These fish are carnivores and in the wild will survive on a diet on crustaceans and small fish. Try to provide a wide variety of meaty sources such as mysis and brine shrimp as well as small crabs and invertebrates. Position the food as close as possible to the fish as they don't like to move around looking for it. Eventually with patience it will learn to accept frozen meat and other carnivore preparations. Keep going with the live food as long as necessary.
