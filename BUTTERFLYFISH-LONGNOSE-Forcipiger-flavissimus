Full Description
<p>
A brightly coloured yellow fish that gets its name from the extremely long snout mouth which it uses to pick up small morsels of food that hide in crevices. The black face mask and eye spot on their tails only adds to their character. 
<p><p>
These fish are originally found all over the Indo-Pacific region from East Africa to the Red Sea and all the way round to southern California, Mexico and the Galapagos Islands. They can usually be found in pairs (sometimes groups of 5+) inhabiting areas with lots of coral growth. They can be spotted at depths of 2-140 metres.
<p><p>
There are no notable differences between sexes and although there has been some success of raising wild-collected larvae, efforts to breed this species in captivity have been fruitless.
<p><p>
Although the long nose butterflyfish looks a little fragile, it is in fact an excellent beginner's fish due to its peaceful nature and ease of feeding.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Long Nose Butterflyfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for a single fish is 280 litres. It will need plenty of swimming space along with live rocks that can be used to create nooks and overhangs. Avoid reefs environments due to its varied natural diet of coral. These fish will do much better in a Fish Only or a Fish Only With Live Rock aquarium. These fish will swim freely all around the tank and will be much happier with a moderate amount of water movement and lighting.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The long nose butterflyfish is a peaceful species that will mix well with most other species as long as they won't eat it or become too aggressive. 
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
This species will do well with boxfish, dragonets, cardinals and clownfish. Small and large species of angels as well as anglers, batfish and blennies will make great tank buddies too. Other excellent choices include puffers, parrotfish, hawkfish and even lion fish.

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Keeping these fish with other butterflyfish is possible but be prepared to separate them if fighting occurs. Caution should also be take when housing with filefish, damsels and eels. Wrasse, triggers, tangs and scorpion fish should also be watched in case they become too boisterous.Most ornamental invertebrates will probably be eaten by the butterflyfish so take care about which ones you add and be prepared to maybe lose them.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Larger predators such as sharks, groupers and snappers will likely see the butterflyfish as prey and as such are to be avoided. Seahorses and pipefish will be too shy around them and may starve to death. This species of butterflyfish is not considered reef-safe as it will pick away and eat most species of live coral.

<h3> Feeding Your Long Nose Butterflyfish</h3>
<p>
These fish are omnivorous but in the wild they live on a primarily carnivorous diet consisting of coral polyps as well as small crustaceans. In the aquarium they will mostly accept a variety of foods such as meaty foods like shrimp and frozen preparations of all different types. Sponge based food and brine shrimp are also good options. They will not thrive on a basic diet so be sure to offer lots of different kinds of food frequently at first until they get accustomed and then be sure to feed the adults at least twice a day. Vegetable matter such as nori and flakes can be suggested to also increase variety and maintain vitamin intake.
