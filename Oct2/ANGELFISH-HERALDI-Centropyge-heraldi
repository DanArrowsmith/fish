Short Description.
<p>
Looking to add a little yellow into your tank? Then look no further. These dwarf angelfish will even get rid of excess micro algae from your aquarium at the same time as looking absolutely stunning.

Full Description
<p>
This species of dwarf angelfish is a bright yellow colour all over but some variants may have a dark area on top that usually fades during captivity. Often confused with their cousin the Lemon Peel Angelfish they can be distinguished by the lack of a blue ring around the eyes. They will swim around the bottom half of the tank like tiny flashes of sunshine.
  </p><p>
Heraldi angelfish are found all over the Pacific ocean from Taiwan to Southern Japan and the Great Barrier Reef. They are usually seen in a group of 1 male and 3-4 females although have been spotted in pairs too. They inhabit lagoon patches and reef/rubble slopes from 5-90 metres deep.
   </p><p>
The males of the species can sometimes develop dark areas with yellow dots behind the eyes when fully matured. Herald's Angel Fish have not shown any signs of reproduction in captivity as of yet.
 </p><p>
As with all angel fish there is some risk to coral when keeping them however their ability to consume algae and detritus will make this challenging fish very rewarding for the intermediate aquarium owner.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Heraldi Angelfish </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 210 litres for a single fish, which must be increased if more females are added.
These fish will spend most of their time swimming around the bottom so a tank that is longer than taller is generally preferred.
Due to the grazing nature of Heraldi Angelfish they should only be added to a tank that is at least 6 months old and well established. This gives the algae plenty of time to accumulate and provide for the fish's nutritional needs. Lots of live rock and places to hide are essential.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Although this species is slightly more passive that its other dwarf angel fish cousins, care should still be taken to only keep them with smaller peaceful or only semi-aggressive fish. Bigger peaceful fish are fine too but avoid adding anything that may cause them stress.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Larger angel fish, basslets and butterfly fish would make a good choice here. They should get along fine with cardinals, clownfish and damsels too. Hawkfish, parrotfish, tangs and puffers will make great tank buddies as well.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Take care when housing with other dwarf angel fish and only do so with a sufficiently large enough tank. Eels, lion fish and rays should be monitored carefully. Live coral and invertebrates may get nipped at too.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Seahorses are a no-go along with pipefish too as the angel fish will out compete them for food allowing them to starve. Sharks will see the Herald's angelfish as prey so they should also be avoided.

<h3> Feeding Your Heraldi Angelfish </h3>
<p>
The species of dwarf angel fish is an omnivore however most of its diet needs to come from plant matter. There should already be plenty of algae growing in the tank when you add the fish for it to graze on. Spirulina and sponge material will go down well too. Meaty foods such as mysis shrimp and other marine flesh can be given sometimes as they will eat small crustaceans in the wild however this is not necessary. Feed them 2-3 times along with all the naturally occurring algae on the live rocks.
