Full Description
<p>
This handsome snail has a pale green shell with multiple maroon stripes and a black, brown or tan foot. These beautiful pyramid shaped shells have been used to make buttons over the years due to their attractive nature. The shells are normally covered with green coralline algae. 
  </p><p>
This species originates from all over the Indo-Pacific region but has also been introduced artificially in various areas around the world for the desirability of its shell and its meat which is known as a delicacy.
   </p><p>
These snails are unisexual which means there is no difference between male and female. They breed extremely easily in the home aquarium and spawning is usually triggered by changes in water conditions or lighting. After a few weeks the free swimming larvae will bury themselves into the sand substrate and slowly develop into adult snails.
   </p><p>
Trochus snails have the useful ability to turn themselves over if they ever get knocked on their backs which allows them to avoid being eaten by predators such as crabs much more easily than other species. This makes them extremely easy to keep for beginner aquarists.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for the Trichus Snail </h3>
<p>
It's possible to keep one Trochus Snail for every 10 litres of water in your tank. They will need lots of hiding places and room to forage. Live rock for grazing is essential for them to thrive. They require a calcium level of 350-450 ppm to aid with shell growth. You will need to slowly acclimatise this species to your tank by using the drip method with a minimum period of two hours.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The Trochus Snails are extremely peaceful creatures, they won't even nip at other invertebrates or live coral. As such it is generally quite easy to keep them with a wide variety of other species as long as some thought is given.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Clownfish, cardinals, damsels and dragonets will not even notice the presence of the snails.  Tangs and scorpions will leave them well alone. These snails can also be kept with other trochus snails as long as tank capacity is considered. As mentioned, they will not bother coral or other invertebrates.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Even with the ability to right itself when knocked over, care must still be taken when keeping the snails with frogfish, angel fish and crustaceans. Lion fish, rays and snapper should also be housed with caution in a tank with trochus snails. Seahorses and pipefish are peaceful towards this species of snail however they do have a similar diet.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
There are a few species of fish which will actively hunt the trochus snail as prey including sharks, triggerfish, parrotfish and wrasse. Puffers, hogfish and eels should be avoided too.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Trochus Snail</h3>
<p>
These snails are omnivorous and will naturally feed on diatoms, cyanobacteria and algae that occurs in the tank on the live rock. They will also forage in the substrate and even graze on the aquarium glass itself. If there isn't a sufficient level of food available in the tank dried nori seaweed may be added to increase consumption. They will occasionally graze on hair algae.
