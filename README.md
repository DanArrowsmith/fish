Short Description.
<p>
Salesy bit of why someone would want to buy the fish to put in their aquarium, so this could be because of it’s colours, personality, your mate won’t have one etc

</p>

Full Description
<p>
Maybe a fuller description about colouration, 
  </p><p>
Maybe where it is originally from.
   </p><p>
  if males and females are different then say what the differences are.  
Maybe if they are likely to breed in the aquarium.
   </p><p>
Any other general information about it.  So stuff like with the Boxfish if it gets stressed or dies it can release toxins that will kill everything in the tank including itself.  Or any tips for keeping them that don’t fit into one of the below sections.
</p>

<h3>Tank Recommendations for (Fish you’re writing abouts name) </h3>
<p>
So here say what the minimum tank size required is
If it likes live rock (maybe it eats algae that grows on the rock etc) Or perhaps it likes it to hide in between cracks and crevices etc.
If it likes a current/water movement maybe add that.
If it’s likely to jump out of a tank like Gobies and Blennies it may need to have atank with a lid on it.
If it likes a tall tank or a long tank
If it needs a sand substrate to bury itself of look for food etc.

Anything else that’s relevant to the actual aquarium set up.
</p>

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Probably something about the fish, like if it’s peaceful then you can say it will mix with most fish that aren’t going to eat it etc.  If it’s really big and aggressive then saying tank mates of a similar size and temperament would be advisable, but be cautious when planning which tank mates to keep with it etc
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
If you can keep a pair or a shoal together then they’d be good tankmates, if they’re peaceful then other peaceful fish that they are compatible with you can list etc.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Again you can look up what fish are going to be usually compatible on the compatibility chart I sent you before.
If its say a wrasse and it’s okay to keep with other wrasses so long as they look different enough or have enough space etc.  Same if you can keep a few together but need to allow a bigger tank or something like that.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Usually this comes down to stuff like who’s likely to eat who, or if they’re a slow moving fish like a Seahorse then you can’t keep them with fish that move quickly and eat the same food as them as they’ll starve etc.  Same with peaceful fish living with aggressive fish that are too scared to come out to eat, they’ll starve too. 
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your (Fish you’re writing abouts name) </h3>
<p>
So information about if it’s a Herbivore, Carnivore or Omnivore, maybe what it eats in the wild and what you can feed it in the Aquarium. Ie live food like Brine shrimp, frozen foods like shredded shrimps or fish or algae wafers or flake and pellet food.  If they have special diets like zooplankton and so need the live Copepods or Rotifers.
Also how many times a day it should be fed etc
