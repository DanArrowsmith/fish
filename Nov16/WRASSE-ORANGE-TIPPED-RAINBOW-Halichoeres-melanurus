WRASSE - ORANGE TIPPED RAINBOW	Halichoeres melanurus

Short Description.
<p>
This colourful and entertaining fish will keep you amused for hours while it darts around and buries itself in and out of the sand. An excellent beginner wrasse and a wonderful choice for your aquarium.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
The Orange Tipped Rainbow Wrasse males have a mauve coloured body with pinkish orange, yellow or blue wavy stripes and a yellow or green head. Equally impressive are the females who look similar but have a silver-blue body with only yellow stripes and a black false eye located near the base of its tail.
  </p><p>
This species originates from all over the Western Pacific Ocean from the Great Barrier Reef and Samoan Islands up to Southern Japan. They love hanging around rocky outcrops and coral reefs and have been seen at depths of up to 15 metres.
   </p><p>
In the wild these fish will exist in a harem consisting of one male and multiple females. If the male dies for whatever reason then the strongest female will begin the transformation into male which takes around 2 weeks.
   </p><p>
This wrasse will be constantly on the move throughout the day but don't be surprised when it buries itself in the sand at the same time every night and gets a good night's rest. This is perfectly normal and it will be out and about early the next morning.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Orange Tipped Rainbow Wrasse </h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this fish is 190 litres and it's extremely important that you provide a fine sand substrate of at least 4 inches in depth in which they can cover themselves for hiding and sleeping. It will probably spent the first few days of entering the tank buried like this until it feels comfortable enough to show itself. Wrasse are notorious jumpers so a well fitting aquarium lid is essential. Provide some small pieces of rock that the wrasse will use when searching for food. They will do well in both fish only and reef environments but be aware that the constant nightly burying may cause instability in your coral structures.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The Orange Tipped Rainbow Wrasse has a peaceful nature and will do well with a variety of different fish species as long as caution is taken when selecting them. Multiple specimens can be kept together if added at the same time and if only 1 male is present however be prepared for the eventual territory disputes over the first week or so.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Large angels and boxfish would be wonderful options to combine with this wrasse. Other great choices can include damsels and even fancy damsels. Tangs would work really good together as well.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Dwarf angels, blennies, cardinals and clownfish must be watched carefully in case the wrasse eats all of their food before they have a chance. Same goes for other species such as eels, goatfish, groupers and grunts. Other fish species that could be tried if a close eye is kept on them are parrotfish, rays, lions and snappers.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Batfish, pipefish and seahorses will probably starve to death in the presence of this wrasse. Larger predators such as sharks will most likely see it as prey. Don't add in crustaceans and invertebrates either unless you are prepared for them to get picked at and maybe even eaten.

<h3> Feeding Your Orange Tipped Rainbow Wrasse</h3>
<p>
This species is carnivorous and has a voracious appetite. For this reason they are often added to tanks to control coral pests and worm problems. It will readily accept most types of meaty foods but ensure that you provide it with a good balance of different types such as brine and mysis shrimp, pieces of fresh seafood, frozen, flake and pellets foods. Feed them twice a day before all the other fish in the aquarium.
