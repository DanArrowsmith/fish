CATFISH - STRIPED - EEL - HAZ - Plotosus - lineatus

Short Description.
<p>
A truly extraordinary species of fish, that will always get a second glance. These eel-like catfish are known for their striped colour pattern and are spotted in coral reefs all around the world.

</p>

Full Description
<p>
The Striped Eel Catfish can grow to almost 14 inches long. They start life as completely black juveniles and develop their distinctive striped markings as they mature. Whitish yellow stripes appear running from the mouth to the tail with the body eventually turning a dark brownish colour. 
  </p><p>
These fish are found all over the Indo-West Pacific Ocean ranging from East Africa and the Red Sea over to Japan and then south down to Australia. They can be spotted in shallow reef areas as well as muddy estuaries. When young they will collect themselves into balls of hundreds of fish in one school until they are big enough to venture out on their own as adults. They will usually stay quite shallow but reports have shown them down to depths of 60 metres.
   </p><p>
This species has been seen to spawn during the summer months in the wild however no known instances of them spawning in captivity have been reported.
   </p><p>
They are the only species of catfish that can be found in coral reefs but take caution with these creatures as they do have sharp spines which are highly venomous and can sometimes even be fatal.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Striped Eel Catfish</h3>
<p>
The juveniles are best kept in groups as they are very sociable. The problem with this is that they can grow quite large as adults and as such keeping them from young should be reserved only for owners of the largest home aquariums. A minimum size size for one fish is 290 litres. A sand, gravel and coral or rock rubble substrate should be provided so they can dig and hide themselves during the day.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
Striped Eel Catfish won't prey on everything in your tank but be aware that anything that is small enough could be potential food. They are semi-aggressive so try to choose bigger tank buddies with a similar temperament. Juveniles should always be kept in a group as they will not do well if separated even to the point of hiding themselves and dying.

<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Larger species will be the best options to combine with these catfish such as big angels, groupers and grunts. Puffers, lions and tangs would also make wonderful tank buddies. Others species that would be a good fit include snappers and scorpions. Catfish won't harm any sort of live coral either.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Caution should be taken when attempting to keep these fish along with species such as smaller angels, frogfish and batfish. Boxfish, butterflies and eels should be watched carefully as well. Crustaceans, rays and parrotfish can sometimes be successful depending on their size. Other species to keep a close eye on are triggers, wrasse and hogfish.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Don't even think about keeping these guys with seahorses and pipefish as they will most likely be eaten. Blennies, clownfish and damsels are a no-go as well. Other species that shouldn't even be considered are dragonets, gobies and goatfish. Invertebrates will almost certainly be seen as prey too. Avoid adding them into tanks that contain sharks unless you're prepared to lose them as the shark's dinner.
</p>

<h3> Feeding Your Striped Eel Catfish </h3>
<p>
These creatures are carnivorous and should be provided with a varied diet containing plenty of frozen or fresh meaty foods. Finely chopped squid, fish flesh and clams should be offered twice daily. They are found of scavenging in the sand so food should be allowed to sink to the bottom of the tank but only add enough for them to consume in one sitting to keep the water quality sustainable.
