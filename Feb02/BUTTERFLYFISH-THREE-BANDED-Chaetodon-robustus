The Three Banded Butterflyfish has a white silvery body with yellow edging.

<h3>Tank Recommendations for Three Banded Butterflyfish</h3>
<p>
The minimum tank size for this species is 290 litres as they require lots of wide open swimming space. Be sure to include plenty of live rock that they can use for hiding places and make sure they already have at least some algae growth which they can graze on. This species will thrive in a Fish Only aquarium setup but coral can be added with caution. No specific water movements or lighting requirements are needed.

<h3>Suitable Tank Buddies </h3>
<p>
The Three Banded Butterflyfish are a peaceful species and as such are best paired with other non-aggressive, peaceful tank buddies.
</p>
<h4>Usually Compatible</h4>
<p>
Excellent tank buddies can include both large and dwarf angelfish, batfish and blennies. Boxfish, cardinals and clownfish will also make wonderful combinations. Other great options are goatfish, gobies and dragonets. Grunts, hawkfish and hogfish will make awesome tank buddies as well.
</p>

<h4>Sometime Compatible</h4>
<p>
Species to keep an eye on when keeping with the Three Banded Butterflyfish include other butterflyfish, crustaceans and damsels. Eels, fancy damsels and filefish will also need to be watched carefully. Invertebrates, rays and scorpions should also only be considered with caution. Squirrelfish, tangs, triggerfish and wrasse can be problematic sometimes as well.
</p>

<h4>Rarely Compatible</h4>
<p>
Large predators such as groupers and sharks should be avoided as they may see the butterflyfish as food. You shouldn't attempt to add snappers to the tank either for the same reason. Seahorses and pipefish may be too shy and docile in the presence of this species and may refuse to come out of hiding and eat.

<h3> Feeding Your Three Banded Butterflyfish </h3>
<p>
These fish are omnivorous in the wild and are normally extremely easy to get accustomed to regular tank foods. Start them on a meaty diet of live black worms and brine shrimp. Later on frozen meaty foods such as mysis shrimp can be offered as well as flake foods which contain Spirulina and other types of seaweed. If you're finding it difficult to get them to eat human consumption clams and mussels can be added into the tank on the half shell to try and entice a feeding response.
